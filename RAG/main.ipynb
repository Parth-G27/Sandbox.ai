The next Bill Gates will not build\\n\\nan operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search\\nengine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t create a social network. If you are\\ncopying these guys, you aren’t learning from them.\\nOf course, it’s easier to copy a model than to make something new. Doing what we\\nalready know how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something\\nfamiliar. But every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1. The act of\\ncreation is singular, as is the moment of creation, and the result is something fresh\\nand strange.\\nUnless they invest in the difficult task of creating new things, American\\ncompanies will fail in the future no matter how big their profits remain today. What\\nhappens when we’ve gained everything to be had from fine-tuning the old lines of\\nbusiness that we’ve inherited? Unlikely as it sounds, the answer threatens to be far\\nworse than the crisis of 2008. Today’s “best practices” lead to dead ends; the best\\npaths are new and untried.\\nIn a world of gigantic administrative bureaucracies both public and private,\\nsearching for a new path might seem like hoping for a miracle. Actually, if American\\nbusiness is going to succeed, we are going to need hundreds, or even thousands, of\\nmiracles. This would be depressing but for one crucial fact: humans are distinguished\\nfrom other species by our ability to work miracles. We call these miracles technology.\\nTechnology is miraculous because it allows us to do more with less, ratcheting up\\nour fundamental capabilities to a higher level. Other animals are instinctively driven\\nto build things like dams or honeycombs, but we are the only ones that can invent\\nnew things and better ways of making them. Humans don’t decide what to build by\\nmaking choices from some cosmic catalog of options given in advance; instead, by\\ncreating new technologies, we rewrite the plan of the world. These are the kind of\\nelementary truths we teach to second graders, but they are easy to forget in a world\\nwhere so much of what we do is repeat what has been done before.\\n\\n Zero to One is about how to build companies that create new things. It draws on\\neverything I’ve learned directly as a co-founder of PayPal and Palantir and then an\\ninvestor in hundreds of startups, including Facebook and SpaceX. But while I have\\nnoticed many patterns, and I relate them here, this book offers no formula for\\nsuccess. The paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula necessarily\\ncannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe\\nin concrete terms how to be innovative. Indeed, the single most powerful pattern I\\nhave noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do\\nthis by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.\\nThis book stems from a course about startups that I taught at Stanford in 2012.\\nCollege students can become extremely skilled at a few specialties, but many never\\nlearn what to do with those skills in the wider world. My primary goal in teaching\\nthe class was to help my students see beyond the tracks laid down by academic\\nspecialties to the broader future that is theirs to create. One of those students, Blake\\nMasters, took detailed class notes, which circulated far beyond the campus, and in\\nZero to One I have worked with him to revise the notes for a wider audience. There’s\\nno reason why the future should happen only at Stanford, or in college, or in Silicon\\nValley.\\n\\n THE CHALLENGE OF THE FUTURE\\n\\nW\\n\\nHENEVER I INTERVIEW someone for a job, I like to ask this question: “What\\n\\nimportant truth do very few people agree with you on?”\\nThis question sounds easy because it’s straightforward. Actually, it’s very hard to\\nanswer. It’s intellectually difficult because the knowledge that everyone is taught in\\nschool is by definition agreed upon. And it’s psychologically difficult because anyone\\ntrying to answer must say something she knows to be unpopular. Brilliant thinking\\nis rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.\\nMost commonly, I hear answers like the following:\\n“Our educational system is broken and urgently needs to be fixed.”\\n“America is exceptional.”\\n“There is no God.”\\nThose are bad answers. The first and the second statements might be true, but\\nmany people already agree with them. The third statement simply takes one side in\\na familiar debate. A good answer takes the following form: “Most people believe in\\nx, but the truth is the opposite of x.” I’ll give my own answer later in this chapter.\\nWhat does this contrarian question have to do with the future? In the most\\nminimal sense, the future is simply the set of all moments yet to come. But what\\nmakes the future distinctive and important isn’t that it hasn’t happened yet, but\\nrather that it will be a time when the world looks different from today. In this sense,\\nif nothing about our society changes for the next 100 years, then the future is over\\n100 years away. If things change radically in the next decade, then the future is\\nnearly at hand. No one can predict the future exactly, but we know two things: it’s\\ngoing to be different, and it must be rooted in today’s world. Most answers to the\\ncontrarian question are different ways of seeing the present; good answers are as\\nclose as we can come to looking into the future.\\n\\n ZERO TO ONE: THE FUTURE OF PROGRESS\\nWhen we think about the future, we hope for a future of progress. That progress can\\ntake one of two forms. Horizontal or extensive progress means copying things that\\nwork—going from 1 to n. Horizontal progress is easy to imagine because we already\\nknow what it looks like. Vertical or intensive progress means doing new things—\\ngoing from 0 to 1. Vertical progress is harder to imagine because it requires doing\\nsomething nobody else has ever done. If you take one typewriter and build 100, you\\nhave made horizontal progress. If you have a typewriter and build a word processor,\\nyou have made vertical progress.\\n\\nAt the macro level, the single word for horizontal progress is globalization—\\ntaking things that work somewhere and making them work everywhere. China is\\nthe paradigmatic example of globalization; its 20-year plan is to become like the\\nUnited States is today. The Chinese have been straightforwardly copying everything\\nthat has worked in the developed world: 19th-century railroads, 20th-century air\\n\\n conditioning, and even entire cities. They might skip a few steps along the way—\\ngoing straight to wireless without installing landlines, for instance—but they’re\\ncopying all the same.\\nThe single word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology. The rapid progress of\\ninformation technology in recent decades has made Silicon Valley the capital of\\n“technology” in general. But there is no reason why technology should be limited to\\ncomputers. Properly understood, any new and better way of doing things is\\ntechnology.\\n\\nBecause globalization and technology are different modes of progress, it’s possible\\nto have both, either, or neither at the same time. For example, 1815 to 1914 was a\\nperiod of both rapid technological development and rapid globalization. Between the\\nFirst World War and Kissinger’s trip to reopen relations with China in 1971, there\\nwas rapid technological development but not much globalization. Since 1971, we\\nhave seen rapid globalization along with limited technological development, mostly\\nconfined to IT.\\nThis age of globalization has made it easy to imagine that the decades ahead will\\nbring more convergence and more sameness. Even our everyday language suggests\\nwe believe in a kind of technological end of history: the division of the world into the\\nso-called developed and developing nations implies that the “developed” world has\\n\\n already achieved the achievable, and that poorer nations just need to catch up.\\nBut I don’t think that’s true. My own answer to the contrarian question is that\\nmost people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the\\ntruth is that technology matters more. Without technological change, if China\\ndoubles its energy production over the next two decades, it will also double its air\\npollution. If every one of India’s hundreds of millions of households were to live the\\nway Americans already do—using only today’s tools—the result would be\\nenvironmentally catastrophic. Spreading old ways to create wealth around the world\\nwill result in devastation, not riches. In a world of scarce resources, globalization\\nwithout new technology is unsustainable.\\nNew technology has never been an automatic feature of history. Our ancestors\\nlived in static, zero-sum societies where success meant seizing things from others.\\nThey created new sources of wealth only rarely, and in the long run they could never\\ncreate enough to save the average person from an extremely hard life. Then, after\\n10,000 years of fitful advance from primitive agriculture to medieval windmills and\\n16th-century astrolabes, the modern world suddenly experienced relentless\\ntechnological progress from the advent of the steam engine in the 1760s all the way\\nup to about 1970. As a result, we have inherited a richer society than any previous\\ngeneration would have been able to imagine.\\nAny generation excepting our parents’ and grandparents’, that is: in the late 1960s,\\nthey expected this progress to continue. They looked forward to a four-day\\nworkweek, energy too cheap to meter, and vacations on the moon. But it didn’t\\nhappen. The smartphones that distract us from our surroundings also distract us\\nfrom the fact that our surroundings are strangely old: only computers and\\ncommunications have improved dramatically since midcentury. That doesn’t mean\\nour parents were wrong to imagine a better future—they were only wrong to expect\\nit as something automatic. Today our challenge is to both imagine and create the\\nnew technologies that can make the 21st century more peaceful and prosperous than\\nthe 20th.\\n\\n STARTUP THINKING\\nNew technology tends to come from new ventures—startups. From the Founding\\nFathers in politics to the Royal Society in science to Fairchild Semiconductor’s\\n“traitorous eight” in business, small groups of people bound together by a sense of\\nmission have changed the world for the better. The easiest explanation for this is\\nnegative: it’s hard to develop new things in big organizations, and it’s even harder to\\ndo it by yourself. Bureaucratic hierarchies move slowly, and entrenched interests shy\\naway from risk. In the most dysfunctional organizations, signaling that work is being\\ndone becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work (if\\nthis describes your company, you should quit now). At the other extreme, a lone\\ngenius might create a classic work of art or literature, but he could never create an\\nentire industry. Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other\\npeople to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually\\ncan.\\nPositively defined, a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a\\nplan to build a different future. A new company’s most important strength is new\\nthinking: even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think.\\nThis book is about the questions you must ask and answer to succeed in the business\\nof doing new things: what follows is not a manual or a record of knowledge but an\\nexercise in thinking. Because that is what a startup has to do: question received ideas\\nand rethink business from scratch.\\n\\n PARTY LIKE IT’S 1999\\n\\nO\\n\\nUR CONTRARIAN QUESTION—What important truth do very few people agree with\\n\\nyou on?—is difficult to answer directly. It may be easier to start with a\\npreliminary: what does everybody agree on? “Madness is rare in individuals—but in\\ngroups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule,” Nietzsche wrote (before he went\\nmad). If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden\\nbehind it: the contrarian truth.\\nConsider an elementary proposition: companies exist to make money, not to lose\\nit. This should be obvious to any thinking person. But it wasn’t so obvious to many in\\nthe late 1990s, when no loss was too big to be described as an investment in an even\\nbigger, brighter future. The conventional wisdom of the “New Economy” accepted\\npage views as a more authoritative, forward-looking financial metric than something\\nas pedestrian as profit.\\nConventional beliefs only ever come to appear arbitrary and wrong in retrospect;\\nwhenever one collapses, we call the old belief a bubble. But the distortions caused by\\nbubbles don’t disappear when they pop. The internet craze of the ’90s was the\\nbiggest bubble since the crash of 1929, and the lessons learned afterward define and\\ndistort almost all thinking about technology today. The first step to thinking clearly\\nis to question what we think we know about the past.\\n\\n A QUICK HISTORY OF THE ’90S\\nThe 1990s have a good image. We tend to remember them as a prosperous,\\noptimistic decade that happened to end with the internet boom and bust. But many\\nof those years were not as cheerful as our nostalgia holds. We’ve long since forgotten\\nthe global context for the 18 months of dot-com mania at decade’s end.\\nThe ’90s started with a burst of euphoria when the Berlin Wall came down in\\nNovember ’89. It was short-lived. By mid-1990, the United States was in recession.\\nTechnically the downturn ended in March ’91, but recovery was slow and\\nunemployment continued to rise until July ’92. Manufacturing never fully\\nrebounded. The shift to a service economy was protracted and painful.\\n1992 through the end of 1994 was a time of general malaise. Images of dead\\nAmerican soldiers in Mogadishu looped on cable news. Anxiety about globalization\\nand U.S. competitiveness intensified as jobs flowed to Mexico. This pessimistic\\nundercurrent drove then-president Bush 41 out of office and won Ross Perot nearly\\n20% of the popular vote in ’92—the best showing for a third-party candidate since\\nTheodore Roosevelt in 1912. And whatever the cultural fascination with Nirvana,\\ngrunge, and heroin reflected, it wasn’t hope or confidence.\\nSilicon Valley felt sluggish, too. Japan seemed to be winning the semiconductor\\nwar. The internet had yet to take off, partly because its commercial use was\\nrestricted until late 1992 and partly due to the lack of user-friendly web browsers. It’s\\ntelling that when I arrived at Stanford in 1985, economics, not computer science, was\\nthe most popular major. To most people on campus, the tech sector seemed\\nidiosyncratic or even provincial.\\nThe internet changed all this. The Mosaic browser was officially released in\\nNovember 1993, giving regular people a way to get online. Mosaic became Netscape,\\nwhich released its Navigator browser in late 1994. Navigator’s adoption grew so\\nquickly—from about 20% of the browser market in January 1995 to almost 80% less\\nthan 12 months later—that Netscape was able to IPO in August ’95 even though it\\nwasn’t yet profitable. Within five months, Netscape stock had shot up from $28 to\\n$174 per share. Other tech companies were booming, too. Yahoo! went public in\\nApril ’96 with an $848 million valuation. Amazon followed suit in May ’97 at $438\\nmillion. By spring of ’98, each company’s stock had more than quadrupled. Skeptics\\n\\n questioned earnings and revenue multiples higher than those for any non-internet\\ncompany. It was easy to conclude that the market had gone crazy.\\nThis conclusion was understandable but misplaced. In December ’96—more than\\nthree years before the bubble actually burst—Fed chairman Alan Greenspan warned\\nthat “irrational exuberance” might have “unduly escalated asset values.” Tech\\ninvestors were exuberant, but it’s not clear that they were so irrational. It is too easy\\nto forget that things weren’t going very well in the rest of the world at the time.\\nThe East Asian financial crises hit in July 1997. Crony capitalism and massive\\nforeign debt brought the Thai, Indonesian, and South Korean economies to their\\nknees. The ruble crisis followed in August ’98 when Russia, hamstrung by chronic\\nfiscal deficits, devalued its currency and defaulted on its debt. American investors\\ngrew nervous about a nation with 10,000 nukes and no money; the Dow Jones\\nIndustrial Average plunged more than 10% in a matter of days.\\nPeople were right to worry. The ruble crisis set off a chain reaction that brought\\ndown Long-Term Capital Management, a highly leveraged U.S. hedge fund. LTCM\\nmanaged to lose $4.6 billion in the latter half of 1998, and still had over $100 billion\\nin liabilities when the Fed intervened with a massive bailout and slashed interest\\nrates in order to prevent systemic disaster. Europe wasn’t doing that much better.\\nThe euro launched in January 1999 to great skepticism and apathy. It rose to $1.19\\non its first day of trading but sank to $0.83 within two years. In mid-2000, G7 central\\nbankers had to prop it up with a multibillion-dollar intervention.\\nSo the backdrop for the short-lived dot-com mania that started in September 1998\\nwas a world in which nothing else seemed to be working. The Old Economy couldn’t\\nhandle the challenges of globalization. Something needed to work—and work in a\\nbig way—if the future was going to be better at all. By indirect proof, the New\\nEconomy of the internet was the only way forward.\\n\\n MANIA: SEPTEMBER 1998–MARCH 2000\\nDot-com mania was intense but short—18 months of insanity from September 1998\\nto March 2000. It was a Silicon Valley gold rush: there was money everywhere, and\\nno shortage of exuberant, often sketchy people to chase it. Every week, dozens of new\\nstartups competed to throw the most lavish launch party. (Landing parties were\\nmuch more rare.) Paper millionaires would rack up thousand-dollar dinner bills and\\ntry to pay with shares of their startup’s stock—sometimes it even worked. Legions of\\npeople decamped from their well-paying jobs to found or join startups. One 40something grad student that I knew was running six different companies in 1999.\\n(Usually, it’s considered weird to be a 40-year-old graduate student. Usually, it’s\\nconsidered insane to start a half-dozen companies at once. But in the late ’90s, people\\ncould believe that was a winning combination.) Everybody should have known that\\nthe mania was unsustainable; the most “successful” companies seemed to embrace a\\nsort of anti-business model where they lost money as they grew. But it’s hard to\\nblame people for dancing when the music was playing; irrationality was rational\\ngiven that appending “.com” to your name could double your value overnight.\\n\\n PAYPAL MANIA\\nWhen I was running PayPal in late 1999, I was scared out of my wits—not because I\\ndidn’t believe in our company, but because it seemed like everyone else in the Valley\\nwas ready to believe anything at all. Everywhere I looked, people were starting and\\nflipping companies with alarming casualness. One acquaintance told me how he had\\nplanned an IPO from his living room before he’d even incorporated his company—\\nand he didn’t think that was weird. In this kind of environment, acting sanely began\\nto seem eccentric.\\nAt least PayPal had a suitably grand mission—the kind that post-bubble skeptics\\nwould later describe as grandiose: we wanted to create a new internet currency to\\nreplace the U.S. dollar. Our first product let people beam money from one PalmPilot\\nto another. However, nobody had any use for that product except the journalists who\\nvoted it one of the 10 worst business ideas of 1999. PalmPilots were still too exotic\\nthen, but email was already commonplace, so we decided to create a way to send and\\nreceive payments over email.\\nBy the fall of ’99, our email payment product worked well—anyone could log in\\nto our website and easily transfer money. But we didn’t have enough customers,\\ngrowth was slow, and expenses mounted. For PayPal to work, we needed to attract a\\ncritical mass of at least a million users. Advertising was too ineffective to justify the\\ncost. Prospective deals with big banks kept falling through. So we decided to pay\\npeople to sign up.\\nWe gave new customers $10 for joining, and we gave them $10 more every time\\nthey referred a friend. This got us hundreds of thousands of new customers and an\\nexponential growth rate. Of course, this customer acquisition strategy was\\nunsustainable on its own—when you pay people to be your customers, exponential\\ngrowth means an exponentially growing cost structure. Crazy costs were typical at\\nthat time in the Valley. But we thought our huge costs were sane: given a large user\\nbase, PayPal had a clear path to profitability by taking a small fee on customers’\\ntransactions.\\nWe knew we’d need more funding to reach that goal. We also knew that the boom\\nwas going to end. Since we didn’t expect investors’ faith in our mission to survive the\\ncoming crash, we moved fast to raise funds while we could. On February 16, 2000,\\n\\n the Wall Street Journal ran a story lauding our viral growth and suggesting that\\nPayPal was worth $500 million. When we raised $100 million the next month, our\\nlead investor took the Journal’s back-of-the-envelope valuation as authoritative.\\n(Other investors were in even more of a hurry. A South Korean firm wired us $5\\nmillion without first negotiating a deal or signing any documents. When I tried to\\nreturn the money, they wouldn’t tell me where to send it.) That March 2000\\nfinancing round bought us the time we needed to make PayPal a success. Just as we\\nclosed the deal, the bubble popped.\\n\\n LESSONS LEARNED\\n’Cause they say 2,000 zero zero party over, oops! Out of time!\\nSo tonight I’m gonna party like it’s 1999!\\n—PRINCE\\nThe NASDAQ reached 5,048 at its peak in the middle of March 2000 and then\\ncrashed to 3,321 in the middle of April. By the time it bottomed out at 1,114 in\\nOctober 2002, the country had long since interpreted the market’s collapse as a kind\\nof divine judgment against the technological optimism of the ’90s. The era of\\ncornucopian hope was relabeled as an era of crazed greed and declared to be\\ndefinitely over.\\nEveryone learned to treat the future as fundamentally indefinite, and to dismiss as\\nan extremist anyone with plans big enough to be measured in years instead of\\nquarters. Globalization replaced technology as the hope for the future. Since the ’90s\\nmigration “from bricks to clicks” didn’t work as hoped, investors went back to bricks\\n(housing) and BRICs (globalization). The result was another bubble, this time in real\\nestate.\\n\\n The entrepreneurs who stuck with Silicon Valley learned four big lessons from the\\ndot-com crash that still guide business thinking today:\\n1. Make incremental advances\\nGrand visions inflated the bubble, so they should not be indulged. Anyone who\\nclaims to be able to do something great is suspect, and anyone who wants to\\nchange the world should be more humble. Small, incremental steps are the only\\nsafe path forward.\\n2. Stay lean and flexible\\nAll companies must be “lean,” which is code for “unplanned.” You should not\\nknow what your business will do; planning is arrogant and inflexible. Instead\\nyou should try things out, “iterate,” and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic\\n\\n experimentation.\\n3. Improve on the competition\\nDon’t try to create a new market prematurely. The only way to know you have\\na real business is to start with an already existing customer, so you should build\\nyour company by improving on recognizable products already offered by\\nsuccessful competitors.\\n4. Focus on product, not sales\\nIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it’s not good\\nenough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\\nBubble-era advertising was obviously wasteful, so the only sustainable growth\\nis viral growth.\\nThese lessons have become dogma in the startup world; those who would ignore\\nthem are presumed to invite the justified doom visited upon technology in the great\\ncrash of 2000. And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct:\\n1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality.\\n2. A bad plan is better than no plan.\\n3. Competitive markets destroy profits.\\n4. Sales matters just as much as product.\\nIt’s true that there was a bubble in technology. The late ’90s was a time of hubris:\\npeople believed in going from 0 to 1. Too few startups were actually getting there,\\nand many never went beyond talking about it. But people understood that we had no\\nchoice but to find ways to do more with less. The market high of March 2000 was\\nobviously a peak of insanity; less obvious but more important, it was also a peak of\\nclarity. People looked far into the future, saw how much valuable new technology\\nwe would need to get there safely, and judged themselves capable of creating it.\\nWe still need new technology, and we may even need some 1999-style hubris and\\nexuberance to get it. To build the next generation of companies, we must abandon\\nthe dogmas created after the crash. That doesn’t mean the opposite ideas are\\nautomatically true: you can’t escape the madness of crowds by dogmatically rejecting\\nthem. Instead ask yourself: how much of what you know about business is shaped by\\n\\n mistaken reactions to past mistakes? The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose\\nthe crowd but to think for yourself.\\n\\n ALL HAPPY COMPANIES ARE\\nDIFFERENT\\n\\nT\\n\\nHE BUSINESS VERSION of our contrarian question is: what valuable company is\\n\\nnobody building? This question is harder than it looks, because your company\\ncould create a lot of value without becoming very valuable itself. Creating value is\\nnot enough—you also need to capture some of the value you create.\\nThis means that even very big businesses can be bad businesses. For example, U.S.\\nairline companies serve millions of passengers and create hundreds of billions of\\ndollars of value each year. But in 2012, when the average airfare each way was $178,\\nthe airlines made only 37 cents per passenger trip. Compare them to Google, which\\ncreates less value but captures far more. Google brought in $50 billion in 2012\\n(versus $160 billion for the airlines), but it kept 21% of those revenues as profits—\\nmore than 100 times the airline industry’s profit margin that year. Google makes so\\nmuch money that it’s now worth three times more than every U.S. airline combined.\\nThe airlines compete with each other, but Google stands alone. Economists use\\ntwo simplified models to explain the difference: perfect competition and monopoly.\\n“Perfect competition” is considered both the ideal and the default state in\\nEconomics 101. So-called perfectly competitive markets achieve equilibrium when\\nproducer supply meets consumer demand. Every firm in a competitive market is\\nundifferentiated and sells the same homogeneous products. Since no firm has any\\nmarket power, they must all sell at whatever price the market determines. If there is\\nmoney to be made, new firms will enter the market, increase supply, drive prices\\ndown, and thereby eliminate the profits that attracted them in the first place. If too\\nmany firms enter the market, they’ll suffer losses, some will fold, and prices will rise\\nback to sustainable levels. Under perfect competition, in the long run no company\\nmakes an economic profit.\\nThe opposite of perfect competition is monopoly. Whereas a competitive firm\\nmust sell at the market price, a monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own\\nprices. Since it has no competition, it produces at the quantity and price combination\\nthat maximizes its profits.\\nTo an economist, every monopoly looks the same, whether it deviously eliminates\\n\\n rivals, secures a license from the state, or innovates its way to the top. In this book,\\nwe’re not interested in illegal bullies or government favorites: by “monopoly,” we\\nmean the kind of company that’s so good at what it does that no other firm can offer\\na close substitute. Google is a good example of a company that went from 0 to 1: it\\nhasn’t competed in search since the early 2000s, when it definitively distanced itself\\nfrom Microsoft and Yahoo!\\nAmericans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist\\nbread lines. Actually, capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is\\npremised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition all profits get\\ncompeted away. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and\\ncapture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.\\n\\n LIES PEOPLE TELL\\nHow much of the world is actually monopolistic? How much is truly competitive?\\nIt’s hard to say, because our common conversation about these matters is so confused.\\nTo the outside observer, all businesses can seem reasonably alike, so it’s easy to\\nperceive only small differences between them.\\n\\nBut the reality is much more binary than that. There’s an enormous difference\\nbetween perfect competition and monopoly, and most businesses are much closer to\\none extreme than we commonly realize.\\n\\nThe confusion comes from a universal bias for describing market conditions in\\nself-serving ways: both monopolists and competitors are incentivized to bend the\\ntruth.\\n\\nMonopoly Lies\\nMonopolists lie to protect themselves. They know that bragging about their great\\nmonopoly invites being audited, scrutinized, and attacked. Since they very much\\n\\n want their monopoly profits to continue unmolested, they tend to do whatever they\\ncan to conceal their monopoly—usually by exaggerating the power of their\\n(nonexistent) competition.\\nThink about how Google talks about its business. It certainly doesn’t claim to be a\\nmonopoly. But is it one? Well, it depends: a monopoly in what? Let’s say that Google\\nis primarily a search engine. As of May 2014, it owns about 68% of the search\\nmarket. (Its closest competitors, Microsoft and Yahoo!, have about 19% and 10%,\\nrespectively.) If that doesn’t seem dominant enough, consider the fact that the word\\n“google” is now an official entry in the Oxford English Dictionary—as a verb. Don’t\\nhold your breath waiting for that to happen to Bing.\\nBut suppose we say that Google is primarily an advertising company. That\\nchanges things. The U.S. search engine advertising market is $17 billion annually.\\nOnline advertising is $37 billion annually. The entire U.S. advertising market is\\n$150 billion. And global advertising is a $495 billion market. So even if Google\\ncompletely monopolized U.S. search engine advertising, it would own just 3.4% of\\nthe global advertising market. From this angle, Google looks like a small player in a\\ncompetitive world.\\n\\nWhat if we frame Google as a multifaceted technology company instead? This\\nseems reasonable enough; in addition to its search engine, Google makes dozens of\\nother software products, not to mention robotic cars, Android phones, and wearable\\ncomputers. But 95% of Google’s revenue comes from search advertising; its other\\n\\n products generated just $2.35 billion in 2012, and its consumer tech products a mere\\nfraction of that. Since consumer tech is a $964 billion market globally, Google owns\\nless than 0.24% of it—a far cry from relevance, let alone monopoly. Framing itself as\\njust another tech company allows Google to escape all sorts of unwanted attention.\\n\\nCompetitive Lies\\nNon-monopolists tell the opposite lie: “we’re in a league of our own.” Entrepreneurs\\nare always biased to understate the scale of competition, but that is the biggest\\nmistake a startup can make. The fatal temptation is to describe your market\\nextremely narrowly so that you dominate it by definition.\\nSuppose you want to start a restaurant that serves British food in Palo Alto. “No\\none else is doing it,” you might reason. “We’ll own the entire market.” But that’s\\nonly true if the relevant market is the market for British food specifically. What if\\nthe actual market is the Palo Alto restaurant market in general? And what if all the\\nrestaurants in nearby towns are part of the relevant market as well?\\nThese are hard questions, but the bigger problem is that you have an incentive not\\nto ask them at all. When you hear that most new restaurants fail within one or two\\nyears, your instinct will be to come up with a story about how yours is different.\\nYou’ll spend time trying to convince people that you are exceptional instead of\\nseriously considering whether that’s true. It would be better to pause and consider\\nwhether there are people in Palo Alto who would rather eat British food above all\\nelse. It’s very possible they don’t exist.\\nIn 2001, my co-workers at PayPal and I would often get lunch on Castro Street in\\nMountain View. We had our pick of restaurants, starting with obvious categories like\\nIndian, sushi, and burgers. There were more options once we settled on a type: North\\nIndian or South Indian, cheaper or fancier, and so on. In contrast to the competitive\\nlocal restaurant market, PayPal was at that time the only email-based payments\\ncompany in the world. We employed fewer people than the restaurants on Castro\\nStreet did, but our business was much more valuable than all of those restaurants\\ncombined. Starting a new South Indian restaurant is a really hard way to make\\nmoney. If you lose sight of competitive reality and focus on trivial differentiating\\nfactors—maybe you think your naan is superior because of your great-grandmother’s\\nrecipe—your business is unlikely to survive.\\nCreative industries work this way, too. No screenwriter wants to admit that her\\nnew movie script simply rehashes what has already been done before. Rather, the\\npitch is: “This film will combine various exciting elements in entirely new ways.” It\\n\\n could even be true. Suppose her idea is to have Jay-Z star in a cross between Hackers\\nand Jaws: rap star joins elite group of hackers to catch the shark that killed his\\nfriend. That has definitely never been done before. But, like the lack of British\\nrestaurants in Palo Alto, maybe that’s a good thing.\\n\\nNon-monopolists exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the\\nintersection of various smaller markets:\\nBritish food ∩ restaurant ∩ Palo Alto\\nRap star ∩ hackers ∩ sharks\\nMonopolists, by contrast, disguise their monopoly by framing their market as the\\nunion of several large markets:\\nsearch engine ∪ mobile phones ∪ wearable computers ∪ self-driving cars\\nWhat does a monopolist’s union story look like in practice? Consider a statement\\nfrom Google chairman Eric Schmidt’s testimony at a 2011 congressional hearing:\\nWe face an extremely competitive landscape in which consumers have a\\n\\n multitude of options to access information.\\nOr, translated from PR-speak to plain English:\\nGoogle is a small fish in a big pond. We could be swallowed whole at any\\ntime. We are not the monopoly that the government is looking for.\\n\\n RUTHLESS PEOPLE\\nThe problem with a competitive business goes beyond lack of profits. Imagine you’re\\nrunning one of those restaurants in Mountain View. You’re not that different from\\ndozens of your competitors, so you’ve got to fight hard to survive. If you offer\\naffordable food with low margins, you can probably pay employees only minimum\\nwage. And you’ll need to squeeze out every efficiency: that’s why small restaurants\\nput Grandma to work at the register and make the kids wash dishes in the back.\\nRestaurants aren’t much better even at the very highest rungs, where reviews and\\nratings like Michelin’s star system enforce a culture of intense competition that can\\ndrive chefs crazy. (French chef and winner of three Michelin stars Bernard Loiseau\\nwas quoted as saying, “If I lose a star, I will commit suicide.” Michelin maintained\\nhis rating, but Loiseau killed himself anyway in 2003 when a competing French\\ndining guide downgraded his restaurant.) The competitive ecosystem pushes people\\ntoward ruthlessness or death.\\nA monopoly like Google is different. Since it doesn’t have to worry about\\ncompeting with anyone, it has wider latitude to care about its workers, its products,\\nand its impact on the wider world. Google’s motto—“Don’t be evil”—is in part a\\nbranding ploy, but it’s also characteristic of a kind of business that’s successful\\nenough to take ethics seriously without jeopardizing its own existence. In business,\\nmoney is either an important thing or it is everything. Monopolists can afford to think\\nabout things other than making money; non-monopolists can’t. In perfect\\ncompetition, a business is so focused on today’s margins that it can’t possibly plan for\\na long-term future. Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute\\nstruggle for survival: monopoly profits.\\n\\n MONOPOLY CAPITALISM\\nSo, a monopoly is good for everyone on the inside, but what about everyone on the\\noutside? Do outsized profits come at the expense of the rest of society? Actually, yes:\\nprofits come out of customers’ wallets, and monopolies deserve their bad reputation\\n—but only in a world where nothing changes.\\nIn a static world, a monopolist is just a rent collector. If you corner the market for\\nsomething, you can jack up the price; others will have no choice but to buy from you.\\nThink of the famous board game: deeds are shuffled around from player to player,\\nbut the board never changes. There’s no way to win by inventing a better kind of\\nreal estate development. The relative values of the properties are fixed for all time,\\nso all you can do is try to buy them up.\\nBut the world we live in is dynamic: it’s possible to invent new and better things.\\nCreative monopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories\\nof abundance to the world. Creative monopolies aren’t just good for the rest of\\nsociety; they’re powerful engines for making it better.\\nEven the government knows this: that’s why one of its departments works hard to\\ncreate monopolies (by granting patents to new inventions) even though another part\\nhunts them down (by prosecuting antitrust cases). It’s possible to question whether\\nanyone should really be awarded a legally enforceable monopoly simply for having\\nbeen the first to think of something like a mobile software design. But it’s clear that\\nsomething like Apple’s monopoly profits from designing, producing, and marketing\\nthe iPhone were the reward for creating greater abundance, not artificial scarcity:\\ncustomers were happy to finally have the choice of paying high prices to get a\\nsmartphone that actually works.\\nThe dynamism of new monopolies itself explains why old monopolies don’t\\nstrangle innovation. With Apple’s iOS at the forefront, the rise of mobile computing\\nhas dramatically reduced Microsoft’s decades-long operating system dominance.\\nBefore that, IBM’s hardware monopoly of the ’60s and ’70s was overtaken by\\nMicrosoft’s software monopoly. AT&T had a monopoly on telephone service for most\\nof the 20th century, but now anyone can get a cheap cell phone plan from any\\nnumber of providers. If the tendency of monopoly businesses were to hold back\\nprogress, they would be dangerous and we’d be right to oppose them. But the history\\n\\n of progress is a history of better monopoly businesses replacing incumbents.\\nMonopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of\\nmonopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate. Then monopolies can\\nkeep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to\\nfinance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can’t dream\\nof.\\nSo why are economists obsessed with competition as an ideal state? It’s a relic of\\nhistory. Economists copied their mathematics from the work of 19th-century\\nphysicists: they see individuals and businesses as interchangeable atoms, not as\\nunique creators. Their theories describe an equilibrium state of perfect competition\\nbecause that’s what’s easy to model, not because it represents the best of business. But\\nit’s worth recalling that the long-run equilibrium predicted by 19th-century physics\\nwas a state in which all energy is evenly distributed and everything comes to rest—\\nalso known as the heat death of the universe. Whatever your views on\\nthermodynamics, it’s a powerful metaphor: in business, equilibrium means stasis,\\nand stasis means death. If your industry is in a competitive equilibrium, the death of\\nyour business won’t matter to the world; some other undifferentiated competitor will\\nalways be ready to take your place.\\nPerfect equilibrium may describe the void that is most of the universe. It may\\neven characterize many businesses. But every new creation takes place far from\\nequilibrium. In the real world outside economic theory, every business is successful\\nexactly to the extent that it does something others cannot. Monopoly is therefore not\\na pathology or an exception. Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.\\nTolstoy opens Anna Karenina by observing: “All happy families are alike; each\\nunhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Business is the opposite. All happy\\ncompanies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All\\nfailed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.\\n\\n THE IDEOLOGY OF COMPETITION\\n\\nC\\n\\nREATIVE MONOPOLY means new products that benefit everybody and sustainable\\n\\nprofits for the creator. Competition means no profits for anybody, no\\nmeaningful differentiation, and a struggle for survival. So why do people believe\\nthat competition is healthy? The answer is that competition is not just an economic\\nconcept or a simple inconvenience that individuals and companies must deal with in\\nthe marketplace. More than anything else, competition is an ideology—the ideology\\n—that pervades our society and distorts our thinking. We preach competition,\\ninternalize its necessity, and enact its commandments; and as a result, we trap\\nourselves within it—even though the more we compete, the less we gain.\\nThis is a simple truth, but we’ve all been trained to ignore it. Our educational\\nsystem both drives and reflects our obsession with competition. Grades themselves\\nallow precise measurement of each student’s competitiveness; pupils with the highest\\nmarks receive status and credentials. We teach every young person the same subjects\\nin mostly the same ways, irrespective of individual talents and preferences. Students\\nwho don’t learn best by sitting still at a desk are made to feel somehow inferior,\\nwhile children who excel on conventional measures like tests and assignments end\\nup defining their identities in terms of this weirdly contrived academic parallel\\nreality.\\nAnd it gets worse as students ascend to higher levels of the tournament. Elite\\nstudents climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense\\nto beat their dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who\\nhad big plans in high school get stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers\\nover conventional careers like management consulting and investment banking. For\\nthe privilege of being turned into conformists, students (or their families) pay\\nhundreds of thousands of dollars in skyrocketing tuition that continues to outpace\\ninflation. Why are we doing this to ourselves?\\nI wish I had asked myself when I was younger. My path was so tracked that in my\\n8th-grade yearbook, one of my friends predicted—accurately—that four years later I\\nwould enter Stanford as a sophomore. And after a conventionally successful\\nundergraduate career, I enrolled at Stanford Law School, where I competed even\\nharder for the standard badges of success.\\n\\n The highest prize in a law student’s world is unambiguous: out of tens of\\nthousands of graduates each year, only a few dozen get a Supreme Court clerkship.\\nAfter clerking on a federal appeals court for a year, I was invited to interview for\\nclerkships with Justices Kennedy and Scalia. My meetings with the Justices went\\nwell. I was so close to winning this last competition. If only I got the clerkship, I\\nthought, I would be set for life. But I didn’t. At the time, I was devastated.\\nIn 2004, after I had built and sold PayPal, I ran into an old friend from law school\\nwho had helped me prepare my failed clerkship applications. We hadn’t spoken in\\nnearly a decade. His first question wasn’t “How are you doing?” or “Can you believe\\nit’s been so long?” Instead, he grinned and asked: “So, Peter, aren’t you glad you\\ndidn’t get that clerkship?” With the benefit of hindsight, we both knew that winning\\nthat ultimate competition would have changed my life for the worse. Had I actually\\nclerked on the Supreme Court, I probably would have spent my entire career taking\\ndepositions or drafting other people’s business deals instead of creating anything\\nnew. It’s hard to say how much would be different, but the opportunity costs were\\nenormous. All Rhodes Scholars had a great future in their past.\\n\\n WAR AND PEACE\\nProfessors downplay the cutthroat culture of academia, but managers never tire of\\ncomparing business to war. MBA students carry around copies of Clausewitz and Sun\\nTzu. War metaphors invade our everyday business language: we use headhunters to\\nbuild up a sales force that will enable us to take a captive market and make a killing.\\nBut really it’s competition, not business, that is like war: allegedly necessary,\\nsupposedly valiant, but ultimately destructive.\\nWhy do people compete with each other? Marx and Shakespeare provide two\\nmodels for understanding almost every kind of conflict.\\nAccording to Marx, people fight because they are different. The proletariat fights\\nthe bourgeoisie because they have completely different ideas and goals (generated,\\nfor Marx, by their very different material circumstances). The greater the\\ndifferences, the greater the conflict.\\nTo Shakespeare, by contrast, all combatants look more or less alike. It’s not at all\\nclear why they should be fighting, since they have nothing to fight about. Consider\\nthe opening line from Romeo and Juliet: “Two households, both alike in dignity.”\\nThe two houses are alike, yet they hate each other. They grow even more similar as\\nthe feud escalates. Eventually, they lose sight of why they started fighting in the first\\nplace.\\nIn the world of business, at least, Shakespeare proves the superior guide. Inside a\\nfirm, people become obsessed with their competitors for career advancement. Then\\nthe firms themselves become obsessed with their competitors in the marketplace.\\nAmid all the human drama, people lose sight of what matters and focus on their\\nrivals instead.\\nLet’s test the Shakespearean model in the real world. Imagine a production called\\nGates and Schmidt, based on Romeo and Juliet. Montague is Microsoft. Capulet is\\nGoogle. Two great families, run by alpha nerds, sure to clash on account of their\\nsameness.\\nAs with all good tragedy, the conflict seems inevitable only in retrospect. In fact it\\nwas entirely avoidable. These families came from very different places. The House\\nof Montague built operating systems and office applications. The House of Capulet\\nwrote a search engine. What was there to fight about?\\n\\n Lots, apparently. As a startup, each clan had been content to leave the other alone\\nand prosper independently. But as they grew, they began to focus on each other.\\nMontagues obsessed about Capulets obsessed about Montagues. The result? Windows\\nvs. Chrome OS, Bing vs. Google Search, Explorer vs. Chrome, Office vs. Docs, and\\nSurface vs. Nexus.\\nJust as war cost the Montagues and Capulets their children, it cost Microsoft and\\nGoogle their dominance: Apple came along and overtook them all. In January 2013,\\nApple’s market capitalization was $500 billion, while Google and Microsoft\\ncombined were worth $467 billion. Just three years before, Microsoft and Google\\nwere each more valuable than Apple. War is costly business.\\nRivalry causes us to overemphasize old opportunities and slavishly copy what has\\nworked in the past. Consider the recent proliferation of mobile credit card readers. In\\nOctober 2010, a startup called Square released a small, white, square-shaped product\\nthat let anyone with an iPhone swipe and accept credit cards. It was the first good\\npayment processing solution for mobile handsets. Imitators promptly sprang into\\naction. A Canadian company called NetSecure launched its own card reader in a halfmoon shape. Intuit brought a cylindrical reader to the geometric battle. In March\\n2012, eBay’s PayPal unit launched its own copycat card reader. It was shaped like a\\ntriangle—a clear jab at Square, as three sides are simpler than four. One gets the\\nsense that this Shakespearean saga won’t end until the apes run out of shapes.\\n\\nThe hazards of imitative competition may partially explain why individuals with\\nan Asperger’s-like social ineptitude seem to be at an advantage in Silicon Valley\\ntoday. If you’re less sensitive to social cues, you’re less likely to do the same things as\\neveryone else around you. If you’re interested in making things or programming\\n\\n computers, you’ll be less afraid to pursue those activities single-mindedly and\\nthereby become incredibly good at them. Then when you apply your skills, you’re a\\nlittle less likely than others to give up your own convictions: this can save you from\\ngetting caught up in crowds competing for obvious prizes.\\nCompetition can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist. The\\ncrazy ’90s version of this was the fierce battle for the online pet store market. It was\\nPets.com vs. PetStore.com vs. Petopia.com vs. what seemed like dozens of others.\\nEach company was obsessed with defeating its rivals, precisely because there were no\\nsubstantive differences to focus on. Amid all the tactical questions—Who could price\\nchewy dog toys most aggressively? Who could create the best Super Bowl ads?—\\nthese companies totally lost sight of the wider question of whether the online pet\\nsupply market was the right space to be in. Winning is better than losing, but\\neverybody loses when the war isn’t one worth fighting. When Pets.com folded after\\nthe dot-com crash, $300 million of investment capital disappeared with it.\\nOther times, rivalry is just weird and distracting. Consider the Shakespearean\\nconflict between Larry Ellison, co-founder and CEO of Oracle, and Tom Siebel, a top\\nsalesman at Oracle and Ellison’s protégé before he went on to found Siebel Systems\\nin 1993. Ellison was livid at what he thought was Siebel’s betrayal. Siebel hated\\nbeing in the shadow of his former boss. The two men were basically identical—\\nhard-charging Chicagoans who loved to sell and hated to lose—so their hatred ran\\ndeep. Ellison and Siebel spent the second half of the ’90s trying to sabotage each\\nother. At one point, Ellison sent truckloads of ice cream sandwiches to Siebel’s\\nheadquarters to try to convince Siebel employees to jump ship. The copy on the\\nwrappers? “Summer is near. Oracle is here. To brighten your day and your career.”\\nStrangely, Oracle intentionally accumulated enemies. Ellison’s theory was that it’s\\nalways good to have an enemy, so long as it was large enough to appear threatening\\n(and thus motivational to employees) but not so large as to actually threaten the\\ncompany. So Ellison was probably thrilled when in 1996 a small database company\\ncalled Informix put up a billboard near Oracle’s Redwood Shores headquarters that\\nread: CAUTION: DINOSAUR CROSSING. Another Informix billboard on northbound\\nHighway 101 read: YOU’VE JUST PASSED REDWOOD SHORES. SO DID WE.\\nOracle shot back with a billboard that implied that Informix’s software was slower\\nthan snails. Then Informix CEO Phil White decided to make things personal. When\\nWhite learned that Larry Ellison enjoyed Japanese samurai culture, he\\ncommissioned a new billboard depicting the Oracle logo along with a broken\\nsamurai sword. The ad wasn’t even really aimed at Oracle as an entity, let alone the\\nconsuming public; it was a personal attack on Ellison. But perhaps White spent a\\n\\n little too much time worrying about the competition: while he was busy creating\\nbillboards, Informix imploded in a massive accounting scandal and White soon\\nfound himself in federal prison for securities fraud.\\nIf you can’t beat a rival, it may be better to merge. I started Confinity with my cofounder Max Levchin in 1998. When we released the PayPal product in late 1999,\\nElon Musk’s X.com was right on our heels: our companies’ offices were four blocks\\napart on University Avenue in Palo Alto, and X’s product mirrored ours feature-forfeature. By late 1999, we were in all-out war. Many of us at PayPal logged 100-hour\\nworkweeks. No doubt that was counterproductive, but the focus wasn’t on objective\\nproductivity; the focus was defeating X.com. One of our engineers actually designed\\na bomb for this purpose; when he presented the schematic at a team meeting, calmer\\nheads prevailed and the proposal was attributed to extreme sleep deprivation.\\nBut in February 2000, Elon and I were more scared about the rapidly inflating\\ntech bubble than we were about each other: a financial crash would ruin us both\\nbefore we could finish our fight. So in early March we met on neutral ground—a\\ncafé almost exactly equidistant to our offices—and negotiated a 50-50 merger. Deescalating the rivalry post-merger wasn’t easy, but as far as problems go, it was a\\ngood one to have. As a unified team, we were able to ride out the dot-com crash and\\nthen build a successful business.\\nSometimes you do have to fight. Where that’s true, you should fight and win.\\nThere is no middle ground: either don’t throw any punches, or strike hard and end it\\nquickly.\\nThis advice can be hard to follow because pride and honor can get in the way.\\nHence Hamlet:\\nExposing what is mortal and unsure\\nTo all that fortune, death, and danger dare,\\nEven for an eggshell. Rightly to be great\\nIs not to stir without great argument,\\nBut greatly to find quarrel in a straw\\nWhen honor’s at the stake.\\nFor Hamlet, greatness means willingness to fight for reasons as thin as an\\neggshell: anyone would fight for things that matter; true heroes take their personal\\nhonor so seriously they will fight for things that don’t matter. This twisted logic is\\npart of human nature, but it’s disastrous in business. If you can recognize\\ncompetition as a destructive force instead of a sign of value, you’re already more sane\\n\\n than most. The next chapter is about how to use a clear head to build a monopoly\\nbusiness.\\n\\n LAST MOVER ADVANTAGE\\n\\nE\\n\\nSCAPING COMPETITION will give you a monopoly, but even a monopoly is only a\\n\\ngreat business if it can endure in the future. Compare the value of the New\\nYork Times Company with Twitter. Each employs a few thousand people, and each\\ngives millions of people a way to get news. But when Twitter went public in 2013, it\\nwas valued at $24 billion—more than 12 times the Times’s market capitalization—\\neven though the Times earned $133 million in 2012 while Twitter lost money. What\\nexplains the huge premium for Twitter?\\nThe answer is cash flow. This sounds bizarre at first, since the Times was\\nprofitable while Twitter wasn’t. But a great business is defined by its ability to\\ngenerate cash flows in the future. Investors expect Twitter will be able to capture\\nmonopoly profits over the next decade, while newspapers’ monopoly days are over.\\nSimply stated, the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will\\nmake in the future. (To properly value a business, you also have to discount those\\nfuture cash flows to their present worth, since a given amount of money today is\\nworth more than the same amount in the future.)\\nComparing discounted cash flows shows the difference between low-growth\\nbusinesses and high-growth startups at its starkest. Most of the value of low-growth\\nbusinesses is in the near term. An Old Economy business (like a newspaper) might\\nhold its value if it can maintain its current cash flows for five or six years. However,\\nany firm with close substitutes will see its profits competed away. Nightclubs or\\nrestaurants are extreme examples: successful ones might collect healthy amounts\\ntoday, but their cash flows will probably dwindle over the next few years when\\ncustomers move on to newer and trendier alternatives.\\nTechnology companies follow the opposite trajectory. They often lose money for\\nthe first few years: it takes time to build valuable things, and that means delayed\\nrevenue. Most of a tech company’s value will come at least 10 to 15 years in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n In March 2001, PayPal had yet to make a profit but our revenues were growing\\n100% year-over-year. When I projected our future cash flows, I found that 75% of\\nthe company’s present value would come from profits generated in 2011 and beyond\\n—hard to believe for a company that had been in business for only 27 months. But\\neven that turned out to be an underestimation. Today, PayPal continues to grow at\\nabout 15% annually, and the discount rate is lower than a decade ago. It now appears\\nthat most of the company’s value will come from 2020 and beyond.\\nLinkedIn is another good example of a company whose value exists in the far\\nfuture. As of early 2014, its market capitalization was $24.5 billion—very high for a\\ncompany with less than $1 billion in revenue and only $21.6 million in net income\\nfor 2012. You might look at these numbers and conclude that investors have gone\\ninsane. But this valuation makes sense when you consider LinkedIn’s projected\\nfuture cash flows.\\n\\n The overwhelming importance of future profits is counterintuitive even in Silicon\\nValley. For a company to be valuable it must grow and endure, but many\\nentrepreneurs focus only on short-term growth. They have an excuse: growth is easy\\nto measure, but durability isn’t. Those who succumb to measurement mania obsess\\nabout weekly active user statistics, monthly revenue targets, and quarterly earnings\\nreports. However, you can hit those numbers and still overlook deeper, harder-tomeasure problems that threaten the durability of your business.\\nFor example, rapid short-term growth at both Zynga and Groupon distracted\\nmanagers and investors from long-term challenges. Zynga scored early wins with\\ngames like Farmville and claimed to have a “psychometric engine” to rigorously\\ngauge the appeal of new releases. But they ended up with the same problem as every\\nHollywood studio: how can you reliably produce a constant stream of popular\\nentertainment for a fickle audience? (Nobody knows.) Groupon posted fast growth as\\nhundreds of thousands of local businesses tried their product. But persuading those\\nbusinesses to become repeat customers was harder than they thought.\\nIf you focus on near-term growth above all else, you miss the most important\\nquestion you should be asking: will this business still be around a decade from now?\\nNumbers alone won’t tell you the answer; instead you must think critically about the\\nqualitative characteristics of your business.\\n\\n CHARACTERISTICS OF MONOPOLY\\nWhat does a company with large cash flows far into the future look like? Every\\nmonopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following\\ncharacteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and\\nbranding.\\nThis isn’t a list of boxes to check as you build your business—there’s no shortcut to\\nmonopoly. However, analyzing your business according to these characteristics can\\nhelp you think about how to make it durable.\\n\\n1. Proprietary Technology\\nProprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have\\nbecause it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate. Google’s search\\nalgorithms, for example, return results better than anyone else’s. Proprietary\\ntechnologies for extremely short page load times and highly accurate query\\nautocompletion add to the core search product’s robustness and defensibility. It\\nwould be very hard for anyone to do to Google what Google did to all the other\\nsearch engine companies in the early 2000s.\\nAs a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better\\nthan its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic\\nadvantage. Anything less than an order of magnitude better will probably be\\nperceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell, especially in an\\nalready crowded market.\\nThe clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely\\nnew. If you build something valuable where there was nothing before, the increase\\nin value is theoretically infinite. A drug to safely eliminate the need for sleep, or a\\ncure for baldness, for example, would certainly support a monopoly business.\\nOr you can radically improve an existing solution: once you’re 10x better, you\\nescape competition. PayPal, for instance, made buying and selling on eBay at least 10\\ntimes better. Instead of mailing a check that would take 7 to 10 days to arrive,\\nPayPal let buyers pay as soon as an auction ended. Sellers received their proceeds\\nright away, and unlike with a check, they knew the funds were good.\\n\\n Amazon made its first 10x improvement in a particularly visible way: they offered\\nat least 10 times as many books as any other bookstore. When it launched in 1995,\\nAmazon could claim to be “Earth’s largest bookstore” because, unlike a retail\\nbookstore that might stock 100,000 books, Amazon didn’t need to physically store\\nany inventory—it simply requested the title from its supplier whenever a customer\\nmade an order. This quantum improvement was so effective that a very unhappy\\nBarnes & Noble filed a lawsuit three days before Amazon’s IPO, claiming that\\nAmazon was unfairly calling itself a “bookstore” when really it was a “book broker.”\\nYou can also make a 10x improvement through superior integrated design. Before\\n2010, tablet computing was so poor that for all practical purposes the market didn’t\\neven exist. “Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition” products first shipped in\\n2002, and Nokia released its own “Internet Tablet” in 2005, but they were a pain to\\nuse. Then Apple released the iPad. Design improvements are hard to measure, but it\\nseems clear that Apple improved on anything that had come before by at least an\\norder of magnitude: tablets went from unusable to useful.\\n\\n2. Network Effects\\nNetwork effects make a product more useful as more people use it. For example, if\\nall your friends are on Facebook, it makes sense for you to join Facebook, too.\\nUnilaterally choosing a different social network would only make you an eccentric.\\nNetwork effects can be powerful, but you’ll never reap them unless your product is\\nvaluable to its very first users when the network is necessarily small. For example, in\\n1960 a quixotic company called Xanadu set out to build a two-way communication\\nnetwork between all computers—a sort of early, synchronous version of the World\\nWide Web. After more than three decades of futile effort, Xanadu folded just as the\\nweb was becoming commonplace. Their technology probably would have worked at\\nscale, but it could have worked only at scale: it required every computer to join the\\nnetwork at the same time, and that was never going to happen.\\nParadoxically, then, network effects businesses must start with especially small\\nmarkets. Facebook started with just Harvard students—Mark Zuckerberg’s first\\nproduct was designed to get all his classmates signed up, not to attract all people of\\nEarth. This is why successful network businesses rarely get started by MBA types:\\nthe initial markets are so small that they often don’t even appear to be business\\nopportunities at all.\\n\\n 3. Economies of Scale\\nA monopoly business gets stronger as it gets bigger: the fixed costs of creating a\\nproduct (engineering, management, office space) can be spread out over ever greater\\nquantities of sales. Software startups can enjoy especially dramatic economies of scale\\nbecause the marginal cost of producing another copy of the product is close to zero.\\nMany businesses gain only limited advantages as they grow to large scale. Service\\nbusinesses especially are difficult to make monopolies. If you own a yoga studio, for\\nexample, you’ll only be able to serve a certain number of customers. You can hire\\nmore instructors and expand to more locations, but your margins will remain fairly\\nlow and you’ll never reach a point where a core group of talented people can provide\\nsomething of value to millions of separate clients, as software engineers are able to\\ndo.\\nA good startup should have the potential for great scale built into its first design.\\nTwitter already has more than 250 million users today. It doesn’t need to add too\\nmany customized features in order to acquire more, and there’s no inherent reason\\nwhy it should ever stop growing.\\n\\n4. Branding\\nA company has a monopoly on its own brand by definition, so creating a strong\\nbrand is a powerful way to claim a monopoly. Today’s strongest tech brand is Apple:\\nthe attractive looks and carefully chosen materials of products like the iPhone and\\nMacBook, the Apple Stores’ sleek minimalist design and close control over the\\nconsumer experience, the omnipresent advertising campaigns, the price positioning\\nas a maker of premium goods, and the lingering nimbus of Steve Jobs’s personal\\ncharisma all contribute to a perception that Apple offers products so good as to\\nconstitute a category of their own.\\nMany have tried to learn from Apple’s success: paid advertising, branded stores,\\nluxurious materials, playful keynote speeches, high prices, and even minimalist\\ndesign are all susceptible to imitation. But these techniques for polishing the surface\\ndon’t work without a strong underlying substance. Apple has a complex suite of\\nproprietary technologies, both in hardware (like superior touchscreen materials) and\\nsoftware (like touchscreen interfaces purpose-designed for specific materials). It\\nmanufactures products at a scale large enough to dominate pricing for the materials\\nit buys. And it enjoys strong network effects from its content ecosystem: thousands of\\ndevelopers write software for Apple devices because that’s where hundreds of\\n\\n millions of users are, and those users stay on the platform because it’s where the apps\\nare. These other monopolistic advantages are less obvious than Apple’s sparkling\\nbrand, but they are the fundamentals that let the branding effectively reinforce\\nApple’s monopoly.\\nBeginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous. Ever since Marissa\\nMayer became CEO of Yahoo! in mid-2012, she has worked to revive the oncepopular internet giant by making it cool again. In a single tweet, Yahoo! summarized\\nMayer’s plan as a chain reaction of “people then products then traffic then revenue.”\\nThe people are supposed to come for the coolness: Yahoo! demonstrated design\\nawareness by overhauling its logo, it asserted youthful relevance by acquiring hot\\nstartups like Tumblr, and it has gained media attention for Mayer’s own star power.\\nBut the big question is what products Yahoo! will actually create. When Steve Jobs\\nreturned to Apple, he didn’t just make Apple a cool place to work; he slashed product\\nlines to focus on the handful of opportunities for 10x improvements. No technology\\ncompany can be built on branding alone.\\n\\n BUILDING A MONOPOLY\\nBrand, scale, network effects, and technology in some combination define a\\nmonopoly; but to get them to work, you need to choose your market carefully and\\nexpand deliberately.\\n\\nStart Small and Monopolize\\nEvery startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its\\nmarket. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. Always err on\\nthe side of starting too small. The reason is simple: it’s easier to dominate a small\\nmarket than a large one. If you think your initial market might be too big, it almost\\ncertainly is.\\nSmall doesn’t mean nonexistent. We made this mistake early on at PayPal. Our\\nfirst product let people beam money to each other via PalmPilots. It was interesting\\ntechnology and no one else was doing it. However, the world’s millions of PalmPilot\\nusers weren’t concentrated in a particular place, they had little in common, and they\\nused their devices only episodically. Nobody needed our product, so we had no\\ncustomers.\\nWith that lesson learned, we set our sights on eBay auctions, where we found our\\nfirst success. In late 1999, eBay had a few thousand high-volume “PowerSellers,”\\nand after only three months of dedicated effort, we were serving 25% of them. It was\\nmuch easier to reach a few thousand people who really needed our product than to\\ntry to compete for the attention of millions of scattered individuals.\\nThe perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people\\nconcentrated together and served by few or no competitors. Any big market is a bad\\nchoice, and a big market already served by competing companies is even worse. This\\nis why it’s always a red flag when entrepreneurs talk about getting 1% of a $100\\nbillion market. In practice, a large market will either lack a good starting point or it\\nwill be open to competition, so it’s hard to ever reach that 1%. And even if you do\\nsucceed in gaining a small foothold, you’ll have to be satisfied with keeping the\\nlights on: cutthroat competition means your profits will be zero.\\n\\n Scaling Up\\nOnce you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand\\ninto related and slightly broader markets. Amazon shows how it can be done. Jeff\\nBezos’s founding vision was to dominate all of online retail, but he very deliberately\\nstarted with books. There were millions of books to catalog, but they all had roughly\\nthe same shape, they were easy to ship, and some of the most rarely sold books—\\nthose least profitable for any retail store to keep in stock—also drew the most\\nenthusiastic customers. Amazon became the dominant solution for anyone located far\\nfrom a bookstore or seeking something unusual. Amazon then had two options:\\nexpand the number of people who read books, or expand to adjacent markets. They\\nchose the latter, starting with the most similar markets: CDs, videos, and software.\\nAmazon continued to add categories gradually until it had become the world’s\\ngeneral store. The name itself brilliantly encapsulated the company’s scaling\\nstrategy. The biodiversity of the Amazon rain forest reflected Amazon’s first goal of\\ncataloging every book in the world, and now it stands for every kind of thing in the\\nworld, period.\\neBay also started by dominating small niche markets. When it launched its\\nauction marketplace in 1995, it didn’t need the whole world to adopt it at once; the\\nproduct worked well for intense interest groups, like Beanie Baby obsessives. Once it\\nmonopolized the Beanie Baby trade, eBay didn’t jump straight to listing sports cars\\nor industrial surplus: it continued to cater to small-time hobbyists until it became the\\nmost reliable marketplace for people trading online no matter what the item.\\nSometimes there are hidden obstacles to scaling—a lesson that eBay has learned\\nin recent years. Like all marketplaces, the auction marketplace lent itself to natural\\nmonopoly because buyers go where the sellers are and vice versa. But eBay found\\nthat the auction model works best for individually distinctive products like coins and\\nstamps. It works less well for commodity products: people don’t want to bid on\\npencils or Kleenex, so it’s more convenient just to buy them from Amazon. eBay is\\nstill a valuable monopoly; it’s just smaller than people in 2004 expected it to be.\\nSequencing markets correctly is underrated, and it takes discipline to expand\\ngradually. The most successful companies make the core progression—to first\\ndominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent markets—a part of their\\nfounding narrative.\\n\\nDon’t Disrupt\\n\\n Silicon Valley has become obsessed with “disruption.” Originally, “disruption” was a\\nterm of art to describe how a firm can use new technology to introduce a low-end\\nproduct at low prices, improve the product over time, and eventually overtake even\\nthe premium products offered by incumbent companies using older technology. This\\nis roughly what happened when the advent of PCs disrupted the market for\\nmainframe computers: at first PCs seemed irrelevant, then they became dominant.\\nToday mobile devices may be doing the same thing to PCs.\\nHowever, disruption has recently transmogrified into a self-congratulatory\\nbuzzword for anything posing as trendy and new. This seemingly trivial fad matters\\nbecause it distorts an entrepreneur’s self-understanding in an inherently competitive\\nway. The concept was coined to describe threats to incumbent companies, so startups’\\nobsession with disruption means they see themselves through older firms’ eyes. If\\nyou think of yourself as an insurgent battling dark forces, it’s easy to become unduly\\nfixated on the obstacles in your path. But if you truly want to make something new,\\nthe act of creation is far more important than the old industries that might not like\\nwhat you create. Indeed, if your company can be summed up by its opposition to\\nalready existing firms, it can’t be completely new and it’s probably not going to\\nbecome a monopoly.\\nDisruption also attracts attention: disruptors are people who look for trouble and\\nfind it. Disruptive kids get sent to the principal’s office. Disruptive companies often\\npick fights they can’t win. Think of Napster: the name itself meant trouble. What\\nkinds of things can one “nap”? Music … Kids … and perhaps not much else. Shawn\\nFanning and Sean Parker, Napster’s then-teenage founders, credibly threatened to\\ndisrupt the powerful music recording industry in 1999. The next year, they made the\\ncover of Time magazine. A year and a half after that, they ended up in bankruptcy\\ncourt.\\nPayPal could be seen as disruptive, but we didn’t try to directly challenge any\\nlarge competitor. It’s true that we took some business away from Visa when we\\npopularized internet payments: you might use PayPal to buy something online\\ninstead of using your Visa card to buy it in a store. But since we expanded the market\\nfor payments overall, we gave Visa far more business than we took. The overall\\ndynamic was net positive, unlike Napster’s negative-sum struggle with the U.S.\\nrecording industry. As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don’t disrupt:\\navoid competition as much as possible.\\n\\n THE LAST WILL BE FIRST\\nYou’ve probably heard about “first mover advantage”: if you’re the first entrant into\\na market, you can capture significant market share while competitors scramble to get\\nstarted. But moving first is a tactic, not a goal. What really matters is generating cash\\nflows in the future, so being the first mover doesn’t do you any good if someone else\\ncomes along and unseats you. It’s much better to be the last mover—that is, to make\\nthe last great development in a specific market and enjoy years or even decades of\\nmonopoly profits. The way to do that is to dominate a small niche and scale up from\\nthere, toward your ambitious long-term vision. In this one particular at least,\\nbusiness is like chess. Grandmaster José Raúl Capablanca put it well: to succeed,\\n“you must study the endgame before everything else.”\\n\\n YOU ARE NOT A LOTTERY TICKET\\n\\nT\\n\\nHE MOST CONTENTIOUS question in business is whether success comes from luck\\n\\nor skill.\\nWhat do successful people say? Malcolm Gladwell, a successful author who writes\\nabout successful people, declares in Outliers that success results from a “patchwork of\\nlucky breaks and arbitrary advantages.” Warren Buffett famously considers himself\\na “member of the lucky sperm club” and a winner of the “ovarian lottery.” Jeff\\nBezos attributes Amazon’s success to an “incredible planetary alignment” and jokes\\nthat it was “half luck, half good timing, and the rest brains.” Bill Gates even goes so\\nfar as to claim that he “was lucky to be born with certain skills,” though it’s not clear\\nwhether that’s actually possible.\\nPerhaps these guys are being strategically humble. However, the phenomenon of\\nserial entrepreneurship would seem to call into question our tendency to explain\\nsuccess as the product of chance. Hundreds of people have started multiple\\nmultimillion-dollar businesses. A few, like Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk,\\nhave created several multibillion-dollar companies. If success were mostly a matter\\nof luck, these kinds of serial entrepreneurs probably wouldn’t exist.\\nIn January 2013, Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter and Square, tweeted to his 2\\nmillion followers: “Success is never accidental.”\\nMost of the replies were unambiguously negative. Referencing the tweet in The\\nAtlantic, reporter Alexis Madrigal wrote that his instinct was to reply: “ ‘Success is\\nnever accidental,’ said all multimillionaire white men.” It’s true that already\\nsuccessful people have an easier time doing new things, whether due to their\\nnetworks, wealth, or experience. But perhaps we’ve become too quick to dismiss\\nanyone who claims to have succeeded according to plan.\\nIs there a way to settle this debate objectively? Unfortunately not, because\\ncompanies are not experiments. To get a scientific answer about Facebook, for\\nexample, we’d have to rewind to 2004, create 1,000 copies of the world, and start\\nFacebook in each copy to see how many times it would succeed. But that experiment\\nis impossible. Every company starts in unique circumstances, and every company\\nstarts only once. Statistics doesn’t work when the sample size is one.\\nFrom the Renaissance and the Enlightenment to the mid-20th century, luck was\\n\\n something to be mastered, dominated, and controlled; everyone agreed that you\\nshould do what you could, not focus on what you couldn’t. Ralph Waldo Emerson\\ncaptured this ethos when he wrote: “Shallow men believe in luck, believe in\\ncircumstances.… Strong men believe in cause and effect.” In 1912, after he became\\nthe first explorer to reach the South Pole, Roald Amundsen wrote: “Victory awaits\\nhim who has everything in order—luck, people call it.” No one pretended that\\nmisfortune didn’t exist, but prior generations believed in making their own luck by\\nworking hard.\\nIf you believe your life is mainly a matter of chance, why read this book?\\nLearning about startups is worthless if you’re just reading stories about people who\\nwon the lottery. Slot Machines for Dummies can purport to tell you which kind of\\nrabbit’s foot to rub or how to tell which machines are “hot,” but it can’t tell you how\\nto win.\\nDid Bill Gates simply win the intelligence lottery? Was Sheryl Sandberg born\\nwith a silver spoon, or did she “lean in”? When we debate historical questions like\\nthese, luck is in the past tense. Far more important are questions about the future: is\\nit a matter of chance or design?\\n\\n CAN YOU CONTROL YOUR FUTURE?\\nYou can expect the future to take a definite form or you can treat it as hazily\\nuncertain. If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand\\nit in advance and to work to shape it. But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by\\nrandomness, you’ll give up on trying to master it.\\nIndefinite attitudes to the future explain what’s most dysfunctional in our world\\ntoday. Process trumps substance: when people lack concrete plans to carry out, they\\nuse formal rules to assemble a portfolio of various options. This describes Americans\\ntoday. In middle school, we’re encouraged to start hoarding “extracurricular\\nactivities.” In high school, ambitious students compete even harder to appear\\nomnicompetent. By the time a student gets to college, he’s spent a decade curating a\\nbewilderingly diverse résumé to prepare for a completely unknowable future. Come\\nwhat may, he’s ready—for nothing in particular.\\nA definite view, by contrast, favors firm convictions. Instead of pursuing manysided mediocrity and calling it “well-roundedness,” a definite person determines the\\none best thing to do and then does it. Instead of working tirelessly to make herself\\nindistinguishable, she strives to be great at something substantive—to be a\\nmonopoly of one. This is not what young people do today, because everyone around\\nthem has long since lost faith in a definite world. No one gets into Stanford by\\nexcelling at just one thing, unless that thing happens to involve throwing or catching\\na leather ball.\\n\\n You can also expect the future to be either better or worse than the present.\\nOptimists welcome the future; pessimists fear it. Combining these possibilities yields\\nfour views:\\n\\nIndefinite Pessimism\\nEvery culture has a myth of decline from some golden age, and almost all peoples\\nthroughout history have been pessimists. Even today pessimism still dominates huge\\nparts of the world. An indefinite pessimist looks out onto a bleak future, but he has no\\nidea what to do about it. This describes Europe since the early 1970s, when the\\ncontinent succumbed to undirected bureaucratic drift. Today the whole Eurozone is\\nin slow-motion crisis, and nobody is in charge. The European Central Bank doesn’t\\nstand for anything but improvisation: the U.S. Treasury prints “In God We Trust”\\non the dollar; the ECB might as well print “Kick the Can Down the Road” on the\\neuro. Europeans just react to events as they happen and hope things don’t get worse.\\nThe indefinite pessimist can’t know whether the inevitable decline will be fast or\\nslow, catastrophic or gradual. All he can do is wait for it to happen, so he might as\\nwell eat, drink, and be merry in the meantime: hence Europe’s famous vacation\\n\\n mania.\\n\\nDefinite Pessimism\\nA definite pessimist believes the future can be known, but since it will be bleak, he\\nmust prepare for it. Perhaps surprisingly, China is probably the most definitely\\npessimistic place in the world today. When Americans see the Chinese economy\\ngrow ferociously fast (10% per year since 2000), we imagine a confident country\\nmastering its future. But that’s because Americans are still optimists, and we project\\nour optimism onto China. From China’s viewpoint, economic growth cannot come\\nfast enough. Every other country is afraid that China is going to take over the world;\\nChina is the only country afraid that it won’t.\\nChina can grow so fast only because its starting base is so low. The easiest way for\\nChina to grow is to relentlessly copy what has already worked in the West. And\\nthat’s exactly what it’s doing: executing definite plans by burning ever more coal to\\nbuild ever more factories and skyscrapers. But with a huge population pushing\\nresource prices higher, there’s no way Chinese living standards can ever actually\\ncatch up to those of the richest countries, and the Chinese know it.\\nThis is why the Chinese leadership is obsessed with the way in which things\\nthreaten to get worse. Every senior Chinese leader experienced famine as a child, so\\nwhen the Politburo looks to the future, disaster is not an abstraction. The Chinese\\npublic, too, knows that winter is coming. Outsiders are fascinated by the great\\nfortunes being made inside China, but they pay less attention to the wealthy Chinese\\ntrying hard to get their money out of the country. Poorer Chinese just save\\neverything they can and hope it will be enough. Every class of people in China takes\\nthe future deadly seriously.\\n\\nDefinite Optimism\\nTo a definite optimist, the future will be better than the present if he plans and works\\nto make it better. From the 17th century through the 1950s and ’60s, definite\\noptimists led the Western world. Scientists, engineers, doctors, and businessmen\\nmade the world richer, healthier, and more long-lived than previously imaginable.\\nAs Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels saw clearly, the 19th-century business class\\ncreated more massive and more colossal productive forces than all\\npreceding generations together. Subjection of Nature’s forces to man,\\n\\n machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steamnavigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for\\ncultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the\\nground—what earlier century had even a presentiment that such\\nproductive forces slumbered in the lap of social labor?\\nEach generation’s inventors and visionaries surpassed their predecessors. In 1843,\\nthe London public was invited to make its first crossing underneath the River\\nThames by a newly dug tunnel. In 1869, the Suez Canal saved Eurasian shipping\\ntraffic from rounding the Cape of Good Hope. In 1914 the Panama Canal cut short\\nthe route from Atlantic to Pacific. Even the Great Depression failed to impede\\nrelentless progress in the United States, which has always been home to the world’s\\nmost far-seeing definite optimists. The Empire State Building was started in 1929\\nand finished in 1931. The Golden Gate Bridge was started in 1933 and completed in\\n1937. The Manhattan Project was started in 1941 and had already produced the\\nworld’s first nuclear bomb by 1945. Americans continued to remake the face of the\\nworld in peacetime: the Interstate Highway System began construction in 1956, and\\nthe first 20,000 miles of road were open for driving by 1965. Definite planning even\\nwent beyond the surface of this planet: NASA’s Apollo Program began in 1961 and\\nput 12 men on the moon before it finished in 1972.\\nBold plans were not reserved just for political leaders or government scientists. In\\nthe late 1940s, a Californian named John Reber set out to reinvent the physical\\ngeography of the whole San Francisco Bay Area. Reber was a schoolteacher, an\\namateur theater producer, and a self-taught engineer. Undaunted by his lack of\\ncredentials, he publicly proposed to build two huge dams in the Bay, construct\\nmassive freshwater lakes for drinking water and irrigation, and reclaim 20,000 acres\\nof land for development. Even though he had no personal authority, people took the\\nReber Plan seriously. It was endorsed by newspaper editorial boards across\\nCalifornia. The U.S. Congress held hearings on its feasibility. The Army Corps of\\nEngineers even constructed a 1.5-acre scale model of the Bay in a cavernous Sausalito\\nwarehouse to simulate it. These tests revealed technical shortcomings, so the plan\\nwasn’t executed.\\nBut would anybody today take such a vision seriously in the first place? In the\\n1950s, people welcomed big plans and asked whether they would work. Today a\\ngrand plan coming from a schoolteacher would be dismissed as crankery, and a longrange vision coming from anyone more powerful would be derided as hubris. You\\ncan still visit the Bay Model in that Sausalito warehouse, but today it’s just a tourist\\n\\n attraction: big plans for the future have become archaic curiosities.\\n\\nIn the 1950s, Americans thought big plans for the future were too important to be left to experts.\\n\\nIndefinite Optimism\\nAfter a brief pessimistic phase in the 1970s, indefinite optimism has dominated\\nAmerican thinking ever since 1982, when a long bull market began and finance\\neclipsed engineering as the way to approach the future. To an indefinite optimist, the\\n\\n future will be better, but he doesn’t know how exactly, so he won’t make any specific\\nplans. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason to design it concretely.\\nInstead of working for years to build a new product, indefinite optimists rearrange\\nalready-invented ones. Bankers make money by rearranging the capital structures of\\nalready existing companies. Lawyers resolve disputes over old things or help other\\npeople structure their affairs. And private equity investors and management\\nconsultants don’t start new businesses; they squeeze extra efficiency from old ones\\nwith incessant procedural optimizations. It’s no surprise that these fields all attract\\ndisproportionate numbers of high-achieving Ivy League optionality chasers; what\\ncould be a more appropriate reward for two decades of résumé-building than a\\nseemingly elite, process-oriented career that promises to “keep options open”?\\nRecent graduates’ parents often cheer them on the established path. The strange\\nhistory of the Baby Boom produced a generation of indefinite optimists so used to\\neffortless progress that they feel entitled to it. Whether you were born in 1945 or\\n1950 or 1955, things got better every year for the first 18 years of your life, and it had\\nnothing to do with you. Technological advance seemed to accelerate automatically, so\\nthe Boomers grew up with great expectations but few specific plans for how to fulfill\\nthem. Then, when technological progress stalled in the 1970s, increasing income\\ninequality came to the rescue of the most elite Boomers. Every year of adulthood\\ncontinued to get automatically better and better for the rich and successful. The rest\\nof their generation was left behind, but the wealthy Boomers who shape public\\nopinion today see little reason to question their naïve optimism. Since tracked careers\\nworked for them, they can’t imagine that they won’t work for their kids, too.\\nMalcolm Gladwell says you can’t understand Bill Gates’s success without\\nunderstanding his fortunate personal context: he grew up in a good family, went to a\\nprivate school equipped with a computer lab, and counted Paul Allen as a childhood\\nfriend. But perhaps you can’t understand Malcolm Gladwell without understanding\\nhis historical context as a Boomer (born in 1963). When Baby Boomers grow up and\\nwrite books to explain why one or another individual is successful, they point to the\\npower of a particular individual’s context as determined by chance. But they miss the\\neven bigger social context for their own preferred explanations: a whole generation\\nlearned from childhood to overrate the power of chance and underrate the\\nimportance of planning. Gladwell at first appears to be making a contrarian critique\\nof the myth of the self-made businessman, but actually his own account encapsulates\\nthe conventional view of a generation.\\n\\n OUR INDEFINITELY OPTIMISTIC WORLD\\nIndefinite Finance\\nWhile a definitely optimistic future would need engineers to design underwater\\ncities and settlements in space, an indefinitely optimistic future calls for more\\nbankers and lawyers. Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it’s the only\\nway to make money when you have no idea how to create wealth. If they don’t go to\\nlaw school, bright college graduates head to Wall Street precisely because they have\\nno real plan for their careers. And once they arrive at Goldman, they find that even\\ninside finance, everything is indefinite. It’s still optimistic—you wouldn’t play in the\\nmarkets if you expected to lose—but the fundamental tenet is that the market is\\nrandom; you can’t know anything specific or substantive; diversification becomes\\nsupremely important.\\nThe indefiniteness of finance can be bizarre. Think about what happens when\\nsuccessful entrepreneurs sell their company. What do they do with the money? In a\\nfinancialized world, it unfolds like this:\\n• The founders don’t know what to do with it, so they give it to a large bank.\\n• The bankers don’t know what to do with it, so they diversify by spreading it\\nacross a portfolio of institutional investors.\\n• Institutional investors don’t know what to do with their managed capital, so they\\ndiversify by amassing a portfolio of stocks.\\n• Companies try to increase their share price by generating free cash flows. If they\\ndo, they issue dividends or buy back shares and the cycle repeats.\\nAt no point does anyone in the chain know what to do with money in the real\\neconomy. But in an indefinite world, people actually prefer unlimited optionality;\\nmoney is more valuable than anything you could possibly do with it. Only in a\\ndefinite future is money a means to an end, not the end itself.\\n\\nIndefinite Politics\\n\\n Politicians have always been officially accountable to the public at election time, but\\ntoday they are attuned to what the public thinks at every moment. Modern polling\\nenables politicians to tailor their image to match preexisting public opinion exactly,\\nso for the most part, they do. Nate Silver’s election predictions are remarkably\\naccurate, but even more remarkable is how big a story they become every four years.\\nWe are more fascinated today by statistical predictions of what the country will be\\nthinking in a few weeks’ time than by visionary predictions of what the country will\\nlook like 10 or 20 years from now.\\nAnd it’s not just the electoral process—the very character of government has\\nbecome indefinite, too. The government used to be able to coordinate complex\\nsolutions to problems like atomic weaponry and lunar exploration. But today, after\\n40 years of indefinite creep, the government mainly just provides insurance; our\\nsolutions to big problems are Medicare, Social Security, and a dizzying array of other\\ntransfer payment programs. It’s no surprise that entitlement spending has eclipsed\\ndiscretionary spending every year since 1975. To increase discretionary spending\\nwe’d need definite plans to solve specific problems. But according to the indefinite\\nlogic of entitlement spending, we can make things better just by sending out more\\nchecks.\\n\\nIndefinite Philosophy\\nYou can see the shift to an indefinite attitude not just in politics but in the political\\nphilosophers whose ideas underpin both left and right.\\nThe philosophy of the ancient world was pessimistic: Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus,\\nand Lucretius all accepted strict limits on human potential. The only question was\\nhow best to cope with our tragic fate. Modern philosophers have been mostly\\noptimistic. From Herbert Spencer on the right and Hegel in the center to Marx on\\nthe left, the 19th century shared a belief in progress. (Remember Marx and Engels’s\\nencomium to the technological triumphs of capitalism from this page.) These\\nthinkers expected material advances to fundamentally change human life for the\\nbetter: they were definite optimists.\\nIn the late 20th century, indefinite philosophies came to the fore. The two\\ndominant political thinkers, John Rawls and Robert Nozick, are usually seen as stark\\nopposites: on the egalitarian left, Rawls was concerned with questions of fairness and\\ndistribution; on the libertarian right, Nozick focused on maximizing individual\\nfreedom. They both believed that people could get along with each other peacefully,\\nso unlike the ancients, they were optimistic. But unlike Spencer or Marx, Rawls and\\n\\n Nozick were indefinite optimists: they didn’t have any specific vision of the future.\\n\\nTheir indefiniteness took different forms. Rawls begins A Theory of Justice with\\nthe famous “veil of ignorance”: fair political reasoning is supposed to be impossible\\nfor anyone with knowledge of the world as it concretely exists. Instead of trying to\\nchange our actual world of unique people and real technologies, Rawls fantasized\\nabout an “inherently stable” society with lots of fairness but little dynamism. Nozick\\nopposed Rawls’s “patterned” concept of justice. To Nozick, any voluntary exchange\\nmust be allowed, and no social pattern could be noble enough to justify maintenance\\nby coercion. He didn’t have any more concrete ideas about the good society than\\nRawls: both of them focused on process. Today, we exaggerate the differences\\nbetween left-liberal egalitarianism and libertarian individualism because almost\\neveryone shares their common indefinite attitude. In philosophy, politics, and\\nbusiness, too, arguing over process has become a way to endlessly defer making\\nconcrete plans for a better future.\\n\\nIndefinite Life\\nOur ancestors sought to understand and extend the human lifespan. In the 16th\\n\\n century, conquistadors searched the jungles of Florida for a Fountain of Youth.\\nFrancis Bacon wrote that “the prolongation of life” should be considered its own\\nbranch of medicine—and the noblest. In the 1660s, Robert Boyle placed life\\nextension (along with “the Recovery of Youth”) atop his famous wish list for the\\nfuture of science. Whether through geographic exploration or laboratory research,\\nthe best minds of the Renaissance thought of death as something to defeat. (Some\\nresisters were killed in action: Bacon caught pneumonia and died in 1626 while\\nexperimenting to see if he could extend a chicken’s life by freezing it in the snow.)\\nWe haven’t yet uncovered the secrets of life, but insurers and statisticians in the\\n19th century successfully revealed a secret about death that still governs our thinking\\ntoday: they discovered how to reduce it to a mathematical probability. “Life tables”\\ntell us our chances of dying in any given year, something previous generations didn’t\\nknow. However, in exchange for better insurance contracts, we seem to have given\\nup the search for secrets about longevity. Systematic knowledge of the current range\\nof human lifespans has made that range seem natural. Today our society is\\npermeated by the twin ideas that death is both inevitable and random.\\nMeanwhile, probabilistic attitudes have come to shape the agenda of biology\\nitself. In 1928, Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming found that a mysterious\\nantibacterial fungus had grown on a petri dish he’d forgotten to cover in his\\nlaboratory: he discovered penicillin by accident. Scientists have sought to harness the\\npower of chance ever since. Modern drug discovery aims to amplify Fleming’s\\nserendipitous circumstances a millionfold: pharmaceutical companies search through\\ncombinations of molecular compounds at random, hoping to find a hit.\\nBut it’s not working as well as it used to. Despite dramatic advances over the past\\ntwo centuries, in recent decades biotechnology hasn’t met the expectations of\\ninvestors—or patients. Eroom’s law—that’s Moore’s law backward—observes that\\nthe number of new drugs approved per billion dollars spent on R&D has halved\\nevery nine years since 1950. Since information technology accelerated faster than\\never during those same years, the big question for biotech today is whether it will\\never see similar progress. Compare biotech startups to their counterparts in computer\\nsoftware:\\n\\n Biotech startups are an extreme example of indefinite thinking. Researchers\\nexperiment with things that just might work instead of refining definite theories\\nabout how the body’s systems operate. Biologists say they need to work this way\\nbecause the underlying biology is hard. According to them, IT startups work because\\nwe created computers ourselves and designed them to reliably obey our commands.\\nBiotech is difficult because we didn’t design our bodies, and the more we learn about\\nthem, the more complex they turn out to be.\\nBut today it’s possible to wonder whether the genuine difficulty of biology has\\nbecome an excuse for biotech startups’ indefinite approach to business in general.\\nMost of the people involved expect some things to work eventually, but few want to\\ncommit to a specific company with the level of intensity necessary for success. It\\nstarts with the professors who often become part-time consultants instead of fulltime employees—even for the biotech startups that begin from their own research.\\nThen everyone else imitates the professors’ indefinite attitude. It’s easy for\\nlibertarians to claim that heavy regulation holds biotech back—and it does—but\\nindefinite optimism may pose an even greater challenge for the future of biotech.\\n\\n IS INDEFINITE OPTIMISM EVEN POSSIBLE?\\nWhat kind of future will our indefinitely optimistic decisions bring about? If\\nAmerican households were saving, at least they could expect to have money to spend\\nlater. And if American companies were investing, they could expect to reap the\\nrewards of new wealth in the future. But U.S. households are saving almost nothing.\\nAnd U.S. companies are letting cash pile up on their balance sheets without investing\\nin new projects because they don’t have any concrete plans for the future.\\n\\nThe other three views of the future can work. Definite optimism works when you\\nbuild the future you envision. Definite pessimism works by building what can be\\ncopied without expecting anything new. Indefinite pessimism works because it’s selffulfilling: if you’re a slacker with low expectations, they’ll probably be met. But\\nindefinite optimism seems inherently unsustainable: how can the future get better if\\nno one plans for it?\\nActually, most everybody in the modern world has already heard an answer to this\\nquestion: progress without planning is what we call “evolution.” Darwin himself\\n\\n wrote that life tends to “progress” without anybody intending it. Every living thing\\nis just a random iteration on some other organism, and the best iterations win.\\nDarwin’s theory explains the origin of trilobites and dinosaurs, but can it be\\nextended to domains that are far removed? Just as Newtonian physics can’t explain\\nblack holes or the Big Bang, it’s not clear that Darwinian biology should explain how\\nto build a better society or how to create a new business out of nothing. Yet in recent\\nyears Darwinian (or pseudo-Darwinian) metaphors have become common in\\nbusiness. Journalists analogize literal survival in competitive ecosystems to corporate\\nsurvival in competitive markets. Hence all the headlines like “Digital Darwinism,”\\n“Dot-com Darwinism,” and “Survival of the Clickiest.”\\nEven in engineering-driven Silicon Valley, the buzzwords of the moment call for\\nbuilding a “lean startup” that can “adapt” and “evolve” to an ever-changing\\nenvironment. Would-be entrepreneurs are told that nothing can be known in\\nadvance: we’re supposed to listen to what customers say they want, make nothing\\nmore than a “minimum viable product,” and iterate our way to success.\\nBut leanness is a methodology, not a goal. Making small changes to things that\\nalready exist might lead you to a local maximum, but it won’t help you find the\\nglobal maximum. You could build the best version of an app that lets people order\\ntoilet paper from their iPhone. But iteration without a bold plan won’t take you from\\n0 to 1. A company is the strangest place of all for an indefinite optimist: why should\\nyou expect your own business to succeed without a plan to make it happen?\\nDarwinism may be a fine theory in other contexts, but in startups, intelligent design\\nworks best.\\n\\n THE RETURN OF DESIGN\\nWhat would it mean to prioritize design over chance? Today, “good design” is an\\naesthetic imperative, and everybody from slackers to yuppies carefully “curates”\\ntheir outward appearance. It’s true that every great entrepreneur is first and\\nforemost a designer. Anyone who has held an iDevice or a smoothly machined\\nMacBook has felt the result of Steve Jobs’s obsession with visual and experiential\\nperfection. But the most important lesson to learn from Jobs has nothing to do with\\naesthetics. The greatest thing Jobs designed was his business. Apple imagined and\\nexecuted definite multi-year plans to create new products and distribute them\\neffectively. Forget “minimum viable products”—ever since he started Apple in\\n1976, Jobs saw that you can change the world through careful planning, not by\\nlistening to focus group feedback or copying others’ successes.\\nLong-term planning is often undervalued by our indefinite short-term world.\\nWhen the first iPod was released in October 2001, industry analysts couldn’t see\\nmuch more than “a nice feature for Macintosh users” that “doesn’t make any\\ndifference” to the rest of the world. Jobs planned the iPod to be the first of a new\\ngeneration of portable post-PC devices, but that secret was invisible to most people.\\nOne look at the company’s stock chart shows the harvest of this multi-year plan:\\n\\nThe power of planning explains the difficulty of valuing private companies.\\n\\n When a big company makes an offer to acquire a successful startup, it almost always\\noffers too much or too little: founders only sell when they have no more concrete\\nvisions for the company, in which case the acquirer probably overpaid; definite\\nfounders with robust plans don’t sell, which means the offer wasn’t high enough.\\nWhen Yahoo! offered to buy Facebook for $1 billion in July 2006, I thought we\\nshould at least consider it. But Mark Zuckerberg walked into the board meeting and\\nannounced: “Okay, guys, this is just a formality, it shouldn’t take more than 10\\nminutes. We’re obviously not going to sell here.” Mark saw where he could take the\\ncompany, and Yahoo! didn’t. A business with a good definite plan will always be\\nunderrated in a world where people see the future as random.\\n\\n YOU ARE NOT A LOTTERY TICKET\\nWe have to find our way back to a definite future, and the Western world needs\\nnothing short of a cultural revolution to do it.\\nWhere to start? John Rawls will need to be displaced in philosophy departments.\\nMalcolm Gladwell must be persuaded to change his theories. And pollsters have to\\nbe driven from politics. But the philosophy professors and the Gladwells of the world\\nare set in their ways, to say nothing of our politicians. It’s extremely hard to make\\nchanges in those crowded fields, even with brains and good intentions.\\nA startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You\\ncan have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of\\nthe world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery\\nticket.\\n\\n FOLLOW THE MONEY\\n\\nM\\n\\nONEY MAKES MONEY. “For whoever has will be given more, and they will have\\n\\nan abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken\\nfrom them” (Matthew 25:29). Albert Einstein made the same observation when he\\nstated that compound interest was “the eighth wonder of the world,” “the greatest\\nmathematical discovery of all time,” or even “the most powerful force in the\\nuniverse.” Whichever version you prefer, you can’t miss his message: never\\nunderestimate exponential growth. Actually, there’s no evidence that Einstein ever\\nsaid any of those things—the quotations are all apocryphal. But this very\\nmisattribution reinforces the message: having invested the principal of a lifetime’s\\nbrilliance, Einstein continues to earn interest on it from beyond the grave by\\nreceiving credit for things he never said.\\nMost sayings are forgotten. At the other extreme, a select few people like Einstein\\nand Shakespeare are constantly quoted and ventriloquized. We shouldn’t be\\nsurprised, since small minorities often achieve disproportionate results. In 1906,\\neconomist Vilfredo Pareto discovered what became the “Pareto principle,” or the 8020 rule, when he noticed that 20% of the people owned 80% of the land in Italy—a\\nphenomenon that he found just as natural as the fact that 20% of the peapods in his\\ngarden produced 80% of the peas. This extraordinarily stark pattern, in which a\\nsmall few radically outstrip all rivals, surrounds us everywhere in the natural and\\nsocial world. The most destructive earthquakes are many times more powerful than\\nall smaller earthquakes combined. The biggest cities dwarf all mere towns put\\ntogether. And monopoly businesses capture more value than millions of\\nundifferentiated competitors. Whatever Einstein did or didn’t say, the power law—\\nso named because exponential equations describe severely unequal distributions—is\\nthe law of the universe. It defines our surroundings so completely that we usually\\ndon’t even see it.\\nThis chapter shows how the power law becomes visible when you follow the\\nmoney: in venture capital, where investors try to profit from exponential growth in\\nearly-stage companies, a few companies attain exponentially greater value than all\\nothers. Most businesses never need to deal with venture capital, but everyone needs\\nto know exactly one thing that even venture capitalists struggle to understand: we\\n\\n don’t live in a normal world; we live under a power law.\\n\\n THE POWER LAW OF VENTURE CAPITAL\\nVenture capitalists aim to identify, fund, and profit from promising early-stage\\ncompanies. They raise money from institutions and wealthy people, pool it into a\\nfund, and invest in technology companies that they believe will become more\\nvaluable. If they turn out to be right, they take a cut of the returns—usually 20%. A\\nventure fund makes money when the companies in its portfolio become more\\nvaluable and either go public or get bought by larger companies. Venture funds\\nusually have a 10-year lifespan since it takes time for successful companies to grow\\nand “exit.”\\nBut most venture-backed companies don’t IPO or get acquired; most fail, usually\\nsoon after they start. Due to these early failures, a venture fund typically loses money\\nat first. VCs hope the value of the fund will increase dramatically in a few years’\\ntime, to break-even and beyond, when the successful portfolio companies hit their\\nexponential growth spurts and start to scale.\\nThe big question is when this takeoff will happen. For most funds, the answer is\\nnever. Most startups fail, and most funds fail with them. Every VC knows that his\\ntask is to find the companies that will succeed. However, even seasoned investors\\nunderstand this phenomenon only superficially. They know companies are different,\\nbut they underestimate the degree of difference.\\n\\n The error lies in expecting that venture returns will be normally distributed: that\\nis, bad companies will fail, mediocre ones will stay flat, and good ones will return 2x\\nor even 4x. Assuming this bland pattern, investors assemble a diversified portfolio\\nand hope that winners counterbalance losers.\\nBut this “spray and pray” approach usually produces an entire portfolio of flops,\\nwith no hits at all. This is because venture returns don’t follow a normal distribution\\noverall. Rather, they follow a power law: a small handful of companies radically\\noutperform all others. If you focus on diversification instead of single-minded\\npursuit of the very few companies that can become overwhelmingly valuable, you’ll\\nmiss those rare companies in the first place.\\nThis graph shows the stark reality versus the perceived relative homogeneity:\\n\\n Our results at Founders Fund illustrate this skewed pattern: Facebook, the best\\ninvestment in our 2005 fund, returned more than all the others combined. Palantir,\\nthe second-best investment, is set to return more than the sum of every other\\ninvestment aside from Facebook. This highly uneven pattern is not unusual: we see\\nit in all our other funds as well. The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best\\ninvestment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund\\ncombined.\\nThis implies two very strange rules for VCs. First, only invest in companies that\\nhave the potential to return the value of the entire fund. This is a scary rule, because\\nit eliminates the vast majority of possible investments. (Even quite successful\\ncompanies usually succeed on a more humble scale.) This leads to rule number two:\\nbecause rule number one is so restrictive, there can’t be any other rules.\\nConsider what happens when you break the first rule. Andreessen Horowitz\\ninvested $250,000 in Instagram in 2010. When Facebook bought Instagram just two\\nyears later for $1 billion, Andreessen netted $78 million—a 312x return in less than\\ntwo years. That’s a phenomenal return, befitting the firm’s reputation as one of the\\nValley’s best. But in a weird way it’s not nearly enough, because Andreessen\\nHorowitz has a $1.5 billion fund: if they only wrote $250,000 checks, they would\\nneed to find 19 Instagrams just to break even. This is why investors typically put a\\nlot more money into any company worth funding. (And to be fair, Andreessen would\\nhave invested more in Instagram’s later rounds had it not been conflicted out by a\\nprevious investment.) VCs must find the handful of companies that will successfully\\n\\n go from 0 to 1 and then back them with every resource.\\nOf course, no one can know with certainty ex ante which companies will succeed,\\nso even the best VC firms have a “portfolio.” However, every single company in a\\ngood venture portfolio must have the potential to succeed at vast scale. At Founders\\nFund, we focus on five to seven companies in a fund, each of which we think could\\nbecome a multibillion-dollar business based on its unique fundamentals. Whenever\\nyou shift from the substance of a business to the financial question of whether or not\\nit fits into a diversified hedging strategy, venture investing starts to look a lot like\\nbuying lottery tickets. And once you think that you’re playing the lottery, you’ve\\nalready psychologically prepared yourself to lose.\\n\\n WHY PEOPLE DON’T SEE THE POWER LAW\\nWhy would professional VCs, of all people, fail to see the power law? For one thing,\\nit only becomes clear over time, and even technology investors too often live in the\\npresent. Imagine a firm invests in 10 companies with the potential to become\\nmonopolies—already an unusually disciplined portfolio. Those companies will look\\nvery similar in the early stages before exponential growth.\\n\\nOver the next few years, some companies will fail while others begin to succeed;\\nvaluations will diverge, but the difference between exponential growth and linear\\ngrowth will be unclear.\\n\\n After 10 years, however, the portfolio won’t be divided between winners and\\nlosers; it will be split between one dominant investment and everything else.\\nBut no matter how unambiguous the end result of the power law, it doesn’t reflect\\ndaily experience. Since investors spend most of their time making new investments\\nand attending to companies in their early stages, most of the companies they work\\nwith are by definition average. Most of the differences that investors and\\nentrepreneurs perceive every day are between relative levels of success, not between\\nexponential dominance and failure. And since nobody wants to give up on an\\ninvestment, VCs usually spend even more time on the most problematic companies\\nthan they do on the most obviously successful.\\n\\n If even investors specializing in exponentially growing startups miss the power\\nlaw, it’s not surprising that most everyone else misses it, too. Power law distributions\\nare so big that they hide in plain sight. For example, when most people outside\\nSilicon Valley think of venture capital, they might picture a small and quirky coterie\\n—like ABC’s Shark Tank, only without commercials. After all, less than 1% of new\\nbusinesses started each year in the U.S. receive venture funding, and total VC\\ninvestment accounts for less than 0.2% of GDP. But the results of those investments\\ndisproportionately propel the entire economy. Venture-backed companies create 11%\\nof all private sector jobs. They generate annual revenues equivalent to an astounding\\n21% of GDP. Indeed, the dozen largest tech companies were all venture-backed.\\nTogether those 12 companies are worth more than $2 trillion, more than all other\\ntech companies combined.\\n\\n WHAT TO DO WITH THE POWER LAW\\nThe power law is not just important to investors; rather, it’s important to everybody\\nbecause everybody is an investor. An entrepreneur makes a major investment just by\\nspending her time working on a startup. Therefore every entrepreneur must think\\nabout whether her company is going to succeed and become valuable. Every\\nindividual is unavoidably an investor, too. When you choose a career, you act on your\\nbelief that the kind of work you do will be valuable decades from now.\\nThe most common answer to the question of future value is a diversified portfolio:\\n“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket,” everyone has been told. As we said, even the\\nbest venture investors have a portfolio, but investors who understand the power law\\nmake as few investments as possible. The kind of portfolio thinking embraced by\\nboth folk wisdom and financial convention, by contrast, regards diversified betting as\\na source of strength. The more you dabble, the more you are supposed to have\\nhedged against the uncertainty of the future.\\nBut life is not a portfolio: not for a startup founder, and not for any individual. An\\nentrepreneur cannot “diversify” herself: you cannot run dozens of companies at the\\nsame time and then hope that one of them works out well. Less obvious but just as\\nimportant, an individual cannot diversify his own life by keeping dozens of equally\\npossible careers in ready reserve.\\nOur schools teach the opposite: institutionalized education traffics in a kind of\\nhomogenized, generic knowledge. Everybody who passes through the American\\nschool system learns not to think in power law terms. Every high school course\\nperiod lasts 45 minutes whatever the subject. Every student proceeds at a similar\\npace. At college, model students obsessively hedge their futures by assembling a suite\\nof exotic and minor skills. Every university believes in “excellence,” and hundredpage course catalogs arranged alphabetically according to arbitrary departments of\\nknowledge seem designed to reassure you that “it doesn’t matter what you do, as\\nlong as you do it well.” That is completely false. It does matter what you do. You\\nshould focus relentlessly on something you’re good at doing, but before that you\\nmust think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.\\nFor the startup world, this means you should not necessarily start your own\\ncompany, even if you are extraordinarily talented. If anything, too many people are\\n\\n starting their own companies today. People who understand the power law will\\nhesitate more than others when it comes to founding a new venture: they know how\\ntremendously successful they could become by joining the very best company while\\nit’s growing fast. The power law means that differences between companies will\\ndwarf the differences in roles inside companies. You could have 100% of the equity\\nif you fully fund your own venture, but if it fails you’ll have 100% of nothing.\\nOwning just 0.01% of Google, by contrast, is incredibly valuable (more than $35\\nmillion as of this writing).\\nIf you do start your own company, you must remember the power law to operate\\nit well. The most important things are singular: One market will probably be better\\nthan all others, as we discussed in Chapter 5. One distribution strategy usually\\ndominates all others, too—for that see Chapter 11. Time and decision-making\\nthemselves follow a power law, and some moments matter far more than others—\\nsee Chapter 9. However, you can’t trust a world that denies the power law to\\naccurately frame your decisions for you, so what’s most important is rarely obvious.\\nIt might even be secret. But in a power law world, you can’t afford not to think hard\\nabout where your actions will fall on the curve.\\n\\n SECRETS\\n\\nE\\n\\nVERY ONE OF TODAY’S most famous and familiar ideas was once unknown and\\n\\nunsuspected. The mathematical relationship between a triangle’s sides, for\\nexample, was secret for millennia. Pythagoras had to think hard to discover it. If you\\nwanted in on Pythagoras’s new discovery, joining his strange vegetarian cult was the\\nbest way to learn about it. Today, his geometry has become a convention—a simple\\ntruth we teach to grade schoolers. A conventional truth can be important—it’s\\nessential to learn elementary mathematics, for example—but it won’t give you an\\nedge. It’s not a secret.\\nRemember our contrarian question: what important truth do very few people agree\\nwith you on? If we already understand as much of the natural world as we ever will\\n—if all of today’s conventional ideas are already enlightened, and if everything has\\nalready been done—then there are no good answers. Contrarian thinking doesn’t\\nmake any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up.\\n\\nOf course, there are many things we don’t yet understand, but some of those\\nthings may be impossible to figure out—mysteries rather than secrets. For example,\\nstring theory describes the physics of the universe in terms of vibrating onedimensional objects called “strings.” Is string theory true? You can’t really design\\nexperiments to test it. Very few people, if any, could ever understand all its\\nimplications. But is that just because it’s difficult? Or is it an impossible mystery?\\nThe difference matters. You can achieve difficult things, but you can’t achieve the\\nimpossible.\\nRecall the business version of our contrarian question: what valuable company is\\nnobody building? Every correct answer is necessarily a secret: something important\\nand unknown, something hard to do but doable. If there are many secrets left in the\\n\\n world, there are probably many world-changing companies yet to be started. This\\nchapter will help you think about secrets and how to find them.\\n\\n WHY AREN’T PEOPLE LOOKING FOR SECRETS?\\nMost people act as if there were no secrets left to find. An extreme representative of\\nthis view is Ted Kaczynski, infamously known as the Unabomber. Kaczynski was a\\nchild prodigy who enrolled at Harvard at 16. He went on to get a PhD in math and\\nbecome a professor at UC Berkeley. But you’ve only ever heard of him because of the\\n17-year terror campaign he waged with pipe bombs against professors, technologists,\\nand businesspeople.\\nIn late 1995, the authorities didn’t know who or where the Unabomber was. The\\nbiggest clue was a 35,000-word manifesto that Kaczynski had written and\\nanonymously mailed to the press. The FBI asked some prominent newspapers to\\npublish it, hoping for a break in the case. It worked: Kaczynski’s brother recognized\\nhis writing style and turned him in.\\nYou might expect that writing style to have shown obvious signs of insanity, but\\nthe manifesto is eerily cogent. Kaczynski claimed that in order to be happy, every\\nindividual “needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to\\nsucceed in attaining at least some of his goals.” He divided human goals into three\\ngroups:\\n1. Goals that can be satisfied with minimal effort;\\n2. Goals that can be satisfied with serious effort; and\\n3. Goals that cannot be satisfied, no matter how much effort one makes.\\nThis is the classic trichotomy of the easy, the hard, and the impossible. Kaczynski\\nargued that modern people are depressed because all the world’s hard problems have\\nalready been solved. What’s left to do is either easy or impossible, and pursuing those\\ntasks is deeply unsatisfying. What you can do, even a child can do; what you can’t do,\\neven Einstein couldn’t have done. So Kaczynski’s idea was to destroy existing\\ninstitutions, get rid of all technology, and let people start over and work on hard\\nproblems anew.\\nKaczynski’s methods were crazy, but his loss of faith in the technological frontier\\nis all around us. Consider the trivial but revealing hallmarks of urban hipsterdom:\\n\\n faux vintage photography, the handlebar mustache, and vinyl record players all hark\\nback to an earlier time when people were still optimistic about the future. If\\neverything worth doing has already been done, you may as well feign an allergy to\\nachievement and become a barista.\\n\\nHipster or Unabomber?\\n\\nAll fundamentalists think this way, not just terrorists and hipsters. Religious\\nfundamentalism, for example, allows no middle ground for hard questions: there are\\neasy truths that children are expected to rattle off, and then there are the mysteries\\nof God, which can’t be explained. In between—the zone of hard truths—lies heresy.\\nIn the modern religion of environmentalism, the easy truth is that we must protect\\nthe environment. Beyond that, Mother Nature knows best, and she cannot be\\nquestioned. Free marketeers worship a similar logic. The value of things is set by the\\nmarket. Even a child can look up stock quotes. But whether those prices make sense\\nis not to be second-guessed; the market knows far more than you ever could.\\nWhy has so much of our society come to believe that there are no hard secrets left?\\nIt might start with geography. There are no blank spaces left on the map anymore.\\nIf you grew up in the 18th century, there were still new places to go. After hearing\\ntales of foreign adventure, you could become an explorer yourself. This was probably\\ntrue up through the 19th and early 20th centuries; after that point photography from\\nNational Geographic showed every Westerner what even the most exotic,\\n\\n underexplored places on earth look like. Today, explorers are found mostly in history\\nbooks and children’s tales. Parents don’t expect their kids to become explorers any\\nmore than they expect them to become pirates or sultans. Perhaps there are a few\\ndozen uncontacted tribes somewhere deep in the Amazon, and we know there\\nremains one last earthly frontier in the depths of the oceans. But the unknown seems\\nless accessible than ever.\\nAlong with the natural fact that physical frontiers have receded, four social trends\\nhave conspired to root out belief in secrets. First is incrementalism. From an early\\nage, we are taught that the right way to do things is to proceed one very small step at\\na time, day by day, grade by grade. If you overachieve and end up learning\\nsomething that’s not on the test, you won’t receive credit for it. But in exchange for\\ndoing exactly what’s asked of you (and for doing it just a bit better than your peers),\\nyou’ll get an A. This process extends all the way up through the tenure track, which\\nis why academics usually chase large numbers of trivial publications instead of new\\nfrontiers.\\nSecond is risk aversion. People are scared of secrets because they are scared of\\nbeing wrong. By definition, a secret hasn’t been vetted by the mainstream. If your\\ngoal is to never make a mistake in your life, you shouldn’t look for secrets. The\\nprospect of being lonely but right—dedicating your life to something that no one\\nelse believes in—is already hard. The prospect of being lonely and wrong can be\\nunbearable.\\nThird is complacency. Social elites have the most freedom and ability to explore\\nnew thinking, but they seem to believe in secrets the least. Why search for a new\\nsecret if you can comfortably collect rents on everything that has already been done?\\nEvery fall, the deans at top law schools and business schools welcome the incoming\\nclass with the same implicit message: “You got into this elite institution. Your\\nworries are over. You’re set for life.” But that’s probably the kind of thing that’s true\\nonly if you don’t believe it.\\nFourth is “flatness.” As globalization advances, people perceive the world as one\\nhomogeneous, highly competitive marketplace: the world is “flat.” Given that\\nassumption, anyone who might have had the ambition to look for a secret will first\\nask himself: if it were possible to discover something new, wouldn’t someone from\\nthe faceless global talent pool of smarter and more creative people have found it\\nalready? This voice of doubt can dissuade people from even starting to look for\\nsecrets in a world that seems too big a place for any individual to contribute\\nsomething unique.\\nThere’s an optimistic way to describe the result of these trends: today, you can’t\\n\\n start a cult. Forty years ago, people were more open to the idea that not all\\nknowledge was widely known. From the Communist Party to the Hare Krishnas,\\nlarge numbers of people thought they could join some enlightened vanguard that\\nwould show them the Way. Very few people take unorthodox ideas seriously today,\\nand the mainstream sees that as a sign of progress. We can be glad that there are\\nfewer crazy cults now, yet that gain has come at great cost: we have given up our\\nsense of wonder at secrets left to be discovered.\\n\\n THE WORLD ACCORDING TO CONVENTION\\nHow must you see the world if you don’t believe in secrets? You’d have to believe\\nwe’ve already solved all great questions. If today’s conventions are correct, we can\\nafford to be smug and complacent: “God’s in His heaven, All’s right with the world.”\\nFor example, a world without secrets would enjoy a perfect understanding of\\njustice. Every injustice necessarily involves a moral truth that very few people\\nrecognize early on: in a democratic society, a wrongful practice persists only when\\nmost people don’t perceive it to be unjust. At first, only a small minority of\\nabolitionists knew that slavery was evil; that view has rightly become conventional,\\nbut it was still a secret in the early 19th century. To say that there are no secrets left\\ntoday would mean that we live in a society with no hidden injustices.\\nIn economics, disbelief in secrets leads to faith in efficient markets. But the\\nexistence of financial bubbles shows that markets can have extraordinary\\ninefficiencies. (And the more people believe in efficiency, the bigger the bubbles\\nget.) In 1999, nobody wanted to believe that the internet was irrationally overvalued.\\nThe same was true of housing in 2005: Fed chairman Alan Greenspan had to\\nacknowledge some “signs of froth in local markets” but stated that “a bubble in\\nhome prices for the nation as a whole does not appear likely.” The market reflected\\nall knowable information and couldn’t be questioned. Then home prices fell across\\nthe country, and the financial crisis of 2008 wiped out trillions. The future turned\\nout to hold many secrets that economists could not make vanish simply by ignoring\\nthem.\\nWhat happens when a company stops believing in secrets? The sad decline of\\nHewlett-Packard provides a cautionary tale. In 1990, the company was worth $9\\nbillion. Then came a decade of invention. In 1991, HP released the DeskJet 500C,\\nthe world’s first affordable color printer. In 1993, it launched the OmniBook, one of\\nthe first “superportable” laptops. The next year, HP released the OfficeJet, the\\nworld’s first all-in-one printer/fax/copier. This relentless product expansion paid off:\\nby mid-2000, HP was worth $135 billion.\\nBut starting in late 1999, when HP introduced a new branding campaign around\\nthe imperative to “invent,” it stopped inventing things. In 2001, the company\\nlaunched HP Services, a glorified consulting and support shop. In 2002, HP merged\\n\\n with Compaq, presumably because it didn’t know what else to do. By 2005, the\\ncompany’s market cap had plunged to $70 billion—roughly half of what it had been\\njust five years earlier.\\nHP’s board was a microcosm of the dysfunction: it split into two factions, only one\\nof which cared about new technology. That faction was led by Tom Perkins, an\\nengineer who first came to HP in 1963 to run the company’s research division at the\\npersonal request of Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard. At 73 years old in 2005, Perkins\\nmay as well have been a time-traveling visitor from a bygone age of optimism: he\\nthought the board should identify the most promising new technologies and then\\nhave HP build them. But Perkins’s faction lost out to its rival, led by chairwoman\\nPatricia Dunn. A banker by trade, Dunn argued that charting a plan for future\\ntechnology was beyond the board’s competence. She thought the board should\\nrestrict itself to a night watchman’s role: Was everything proper in the accounting\\ndepartment? Were people following all the rules?\\nAmid this infighting, someone on the board started leaking information to the\\npress. When it was exposed that Dunn arranged a series of illegal wiretaps to\\nidentify the source, the backlash was worse than the original dissension, and the\\nboard was disgraced. Having abandoned the search for technological secrets, HP\\nobsessed over gossip. As a result, by late 2012 HP was worth just $23 billion—not\\nmuch more than it was worth in 1990, adjusting for inflation.\\n\\n THE CASE FOR SECRETS\\nYou can’t find secrets without looking for them. Andrew Wiles demonstrated this\\nwhen he proved Fermat’s Last Theorem after 358 years of fruitless inquiry by other\\nmathematicians—the kind of sustained failure that might have suggested an\\ninherently impossible task. Pierre de Fermat had conjectured in 1637 that no\\nintegers a, b, and c could satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer n greater\\nthan 2. He claimed to have a proof, but he died without writing it down, so his\\nconjecture long remained a major unsolved problem in mathematics. Wiles started\\nworking on it in 1986, but he kept it a secret until 1993, when he knew he was\\nnearing a solution. After nine years of hard work, Wiles proved the conjecture in\\n1995. He needed brilliance to succeed, but he also needed a faith in secrets. If you\\nthink something hard is impossible, you’ll never even start trying to achieve it. Belief\\nin secrets is an effective truth.\\nThe actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find, but they will\\nyield only to relentless searchers. There is more to do in science, medicine,\\nengineering, and in technology of all kinds. We are within reach not just of marginal\\ngoals set at the competitive edge of today’s conventional disciplines, but of ambitions\\nso great that even the boldest minds of the Scientific Revolution hesitated to\\nannounce them directly. We could cure cancer, dementia, and all the diseases of age\\nand metabolic decay. We can find new ways to generate energy that free the world\\nfrom conflict over fossil fuels. We can invent faster ways to travel from place to place\\nover the surface of the planet; we can even learn how to escape it entirely and settle\\nnew frontiers. But we will never learn any of these secrets unless we demand to\\nknow them and force ourselves to look.\\nThe same is true of business. Great companies can be built on open but\\nunsuspected secrets about how the world works. Consider the Silicon Valley startups\\nthat have harnessed the spare capacity that is all around us but often ignored. Before\\nAirbnb, travelers had little choice but to pay high prices for a hotel room, and\\nproperty owners couldn’t easily and reliably rent out their unoccupied space. Airbnb\\nsaw untapped supply and unaddressed demand where others saw nothing at all. The\\nsame is true of private car services Lyft and Uber. Few people imagined that it was\\npossible to build a billion-dollar business by simply connecting people who want to\\n\\n go places with people willing to drive them there. We already had state-licensed\\ntaxicabs and private limousines; only by believing in and looking for secrets could\\nyou see beyond the convention to an opportunity hidden in plain sight. The same\\nreason that so many internet companies, including Facebook, are often\\nunderestimated—their very simplicity—is itself an argument for secrets. If insights\\nthat look so elementary in retrospect can support important and valuable businesses,\\nthere must remain many great companies still to start.\\n\\n HOW TO FIND SECRETS\\nThere are two kinds of secrets: secrets of nature and secrets about people. Natural\\nsecrets exist all around us; to find them, one must study some undiscovered aspect of\\nthe physical world. Secrets about people are different: they are things that people\\ndon’t know about themselves or things they hide because they don’t want others to\\nknow. So when thinking about what kind of company to build, there are two distinct\\nquestions to ask: What secrets is nature not telling you? What secrets are people not\\ntelling you?\\nIt’s easy to assume that natural secrets are the most important: the people who\\nlook for them can sound intimidatingly authoritative. This is why physics PhDs are\\nnotoriously difficult to work with—because they know the most fundamental truths,\\nthey think they know all truths. But does understanding electromagnetic theory\\nautomatically make you a great marriage counselor? Does a gravity theorist know\\nmore about your business than you do? At PayPal, I once interviewed a physics PhD\\nfor an engineering job. Halfway through my first question, he shouted, “Stop! I\\nalready know what you’re going to ask!” But he was wrong. It was the easiest no-hire\\ndecision I’ve ever made.\\nSecrets about people are relatively underappreciated. Maybe that’s because you\\ndon’t need a dozen years of higher education to ask the questions that uncover them:\\nWhat are people not allowed to talk about? What is forbidden or taboo?\\nSometimes looking for natural secrets and looking for human secrets lead to the\\nsame truth. Consider the monopoly secret again: competition and capitalism are\\nopposites. If you didn’t already know it, you could discover it the natural, empirical\\nway: do a quantitative study of corporate profits and you’ll see they’re eliminated by\\ncompetition. But you could also take the human approach and ask: what are people\\nrunning companies not allowed to say? You would notice that monopolists downplay\\ntheir monopoly status to avoid scrutiny, while competitive firms strategically\\nexaggerate their uniqueness. The differences between firms only seem small on the\\nsurface; in fact, they are enormous.\\nThe best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking. Most people\\nthink only in terms of what they’ve been taught; schooling itself aims to impart\\nconventional wisdom. So you might ask: are there any fields that matter but haven’t\\n\\n been standardized and institutionalized? Physics, for example, is a real major at all\\nmajor universities, and it’s set in its ways. The opposite of physics might be astrology,\\nbut astrology doesn’t matter. What about something like nutrition? Nutrition\\nmatters for everybody, but you can’t major in it at Harvard. Most top scientists go\\ninto other fields. Most of the big studies were done 30 or 40 years ago, and most are\\nseriously flawed. The food pyramid that told us to eat low fat and enormous amounts\\nof grains was probably more a product of lobbying by Big Food than real science; its\\nchief impact has been to aggravate our obesity epidemic. There’s plenty more to\\nlearn: we know more about the physics of faraway stars than we know about human\\nnutrition. It won’t be easy, but it’s not obviously impossible: exactly the kind of field\\nthat could yield secrets.\\n\\n WHAT TO DO WITH SECRETS\\nIf you find a secret, you face a choice: Do you tell anyone? Or do you keep it to\\nyourself?\\nIt depends on the secret: some are more dangerous than others. As Faust tells\\nWagner:\\nThe few who knew what might be learned,\\nFoolish enough to put their whole heart on show, And reveal their feelings to the crowd\\nbelow, Mankind has always crucified and burned.\\nUnless you have perfectly conventional beliefs, it’s rarely a good idea to tell\\neverybody everything that you know.\\nSo who do you tell? Whoever you need to, and no more. In practice, there’s always\\na golden mean between telling nobody and telling everybody—and that’s a\\ncompany. The best entrepreneurs know this: every great business is built around a\\nsecret that’s hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the\\nworld; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator.\\nAs Tolkien wrote in The Lord of the Rings:\\nThe Road goes ever on and on\\nDown from the door where it began.\\nLife is a long journey; the road marked out by the steps of previous travelers has\\nno end in sight. But later on in the tale, another verse appears:\\nStill round the corner there may wait\\nA new road or a secret gate,\\nAnd though we pass them by today,\\nTomorrow we may come this way\\nAnd take the hidden paths that run\\nTowards the Moon or to the Sun.\\nThe road doesn’t have to be infinite after all. Take the hidden paths.\\n\\n FOUNDATIONS\\n\\nE\\n\\nVERY GREAT COMPANY is unique, but there are a few things that every business\\n\\nmust get right at the beginning. I stress this so often that friends have teasingly\\nnicknamed it “Thiel’s law”: a startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed.\\nBeginnings are special. They are qualitatively different from all that comes\\nafterward. This was true 13.8 billion years ago, at the founding of our cosmos: in the\\nearliest microseconds of its existence, the universe expanded by a factor of 1030—a\\nmillion trillion trillion. As cosmogonic epochs came and went in those first few\\nmoments, the very laws of physics were different from those we know today.\\nIt was also true 227 years ago at the founding of our country: fundamental\\nquestions were open for debate by the Framers during the few months they spent\\ntogether at the Constitutional Convention. How much power should the central\\ngovernment have? How should representation in Congress be apportioned? Whatever\\nyour views on the compromises reached that summer in Philadelphia, they’ve been\\nhard to change ever since: after ratifying the Bill of Rights in 1791, we’ve amended\\nthe Constitution only 17 times. Today, California has the same representation in the\\nSenate as Alaska, even though it has more than 50 times as many people. Maybe\\nthat’s a feature, not a bug. But we’re probably stuck with it as long as the United\\nStates exists. Another constitutional convention is unlikely; today we debate only\\nsmaller questions.\\nCompanies are like countries in this way. Bad decisions made early on—if you\\nchoose the wrong partners or hire the wrong people, for example—are very hard to\\ncorrect after they are made. It may take a crisis on the order of bankruptcy before\\nanybody will even try to correct them. As a founder, your first job is to get the first\\nthings right, because you cannot build a great company on a flawed foundation.\\n\\n FOUNDING MATRIMONY\\nWhen you start something, the first and most crucial decision you make is whom to\\nstart it with. Choosing a co-founder is like getting married, and founder conflict is\\njust as ugly as divorce. Optimism abounds at the start of every relationship. It’s\\nunromantic to think soberly about what could go wrong, so people don’t. But if the\\nfounders develop irreconcilable differences, the company becomes the victim.\\nIn 1999, Luke Nosek was one of my co-founders at PayPal, and I still work with\\nhim today at Founders Fund. But a year before PayPal, I invested in a company\\nLuke started with someone else. It was his first startup; it was one of my first\\ninvestments. Neither of us realized it then, but the venture was doomed to fail from\\nthe beginning because Luke and his co-founder were a terrible match. Luke is a\\nbrilliant and eccentric thinker; his co-founder was an MBA type who didn’t want to\\nmiss out on the ’90s gold rush. They met at a networking event, talked for a while,\\nand decided to start a company together. That’s no better than marrying the first\\nperson you meet at the slot machines in Vegas: you might hit the jackpot, but it\\nprobably won’t work. Their company blew up and I lost my money.\\nNow when I consider investing in a startup, I study the founding teams. Technical\\nabilities and complementary skill sets matter, but how well the founders know each\\nother and how well they work together matter just as much. Founders should share a\\nprehistory before they start a company together—otherwise they’re just rolling dice.\\n\\n OWNERSHIP, POSSESSION, AND CONTROL\\nIt’s not just founders who need to get along. Everyone in your company needs to\\nwork well together. A Silicon Valley libertarian might say you could solve this\\nproblem by restricting yourself to a sole proprietorship. Freud, Jung, and every other\\npsychologist has a theory about how every individual mind is divided against itself,\\nbut in business at least, working for yourself guarantees alignment. Unfortunately, it\\nalso limits what kind of company you can build. It’s very hard to go from 0 to 1\\nwithout a team.\\nA Silicon Valley anarchist might say you could achieve perfect alignment as long\\nas you hire just the right people, who will flourish peacefully without any guiding\\nstructure. Serendipity and even free-form chaos at the workplace are supposed to\\nhelp “disrupt” all the old rules made and obeyed by the rest of the world. And\\nindeed, “if men were angels, no government would be necessary.” But anarchic\\ncompanies miss what James Madison saw: men aren’t angels. That’s why executives\\nwho manage companies and directors who govern them have separate roles to play;\\nit’s also why founders’ and investors’ claims on a company are formally defined. You\\nneed good people who get along, but you also need a structure to help keep everyone\\naligned for the long term.\\nTo anticipate likely sources of misalignment in any company, it’s useful to\\ndistinguish between three concepts:\\n• Ownership: who legally owns a company’s equity?\\n• Possession: who actually runs the company on a day-to-day basis?\\n• Control: who formally governs the company’s affairs?\\nA typical startup allocates ownership among founders, employees, and investors.\\nThe managers and employees who operate the company enjoy possession. And a\\nboard of directors, usually comprising founders and investors, exercises control.\\nIn theory, this division works smoothly. Financial upside from part ownership\\nattracts and rewards investors and workers. Effective possession motivates and\\nempowers founders and employees—it means they can get stuff done. Oversight\\nfrom the board places managers’ plans in a broader perspective. In practice,\\ndistributing these functions among different people makes sense, but it also\\n\\n multiplies opportunities for misalignment.\\nTo see misalignment at its most extreme, just visit the DMV. Suppose you need a\\nnew driver’s license. Theoretically, it should be easy to get one. The DMV is a\\ngovernment agency, and we live in a democratic republic. All power resides in “the\\npeople,” who elect representatives to serve them in government. If you’re a citizen,\\nyou’re a part owner of the DMV and your representatives control it, so you should be\\nable to walk in and get what you need.\\nOf course, it doesn’t work like that. We the people may “own” the DMV’s\\nresources, but that ownership is merely fictional. The clerks and petty tyrants who\\noperate the DMV, however, enjoy very real possession of their small-time powers.\\nEven the governor and the legislature charged with nominal control over the DMV\\ncan’t change anything. The bureaucracy lurches ever sideways of its own inertia no\\nmatter what actions elected officials take. Accountable to nobody, the DMV is\\nmisaligned with everybody. Bureaucrats can make your licensing experience\\npleasurable or nightmarish at their sole discretion. You can try to bring up political\\ntheory and remind them that you are the boss, but that’s unlikely to get you better\\nservice.\\nBig corporations do better than the DMV, but they’re still prone to misalignment,\\nespecially between ownership and possession. The CEO of a huge company like\\nGeneral Motors, for example, will own some of the company’s stock, but only a\\ntrivial portion of the total. Therefore he’s incentivized to reward himself through the\\npower of possession rather than the value of ownership. Posting good quarterly\\nresults will be enough for him to keep his high salary and corporate jet.\\nMisalignment can creep in even if he receives stock compensation in the name of\\n“shareholder value.” If that stock comes as a reward for short-term performance, he\\nwill find it more lucrative and much easier to cut costs instead of investing in a plan\\nthat might create more value for all shareholders far in the future.\\nUnlike corporate giants, early-stage startups are small enough that founders\\nusually have both ownership and possession. Most conflicts in a startup erupt\\nbetween ownership and control—that is, between founders and investors on the\\nboard. The potential for conflict increases over time as interests diverge: a board\\nmember might want to take a company public as soon as possible to score a win for\\nhis venture firm, while the founders would prefer to stay private and grow the\\nbusiness.\\nIn the boardroom, less is more. The smaller the board, the easier it is for the\\ndirectors to communicate, to reach consensus, and to exercise effective oversight.\\nHowever, that very effectiveness means that a small board can forcefully oppose\\n\\n management in any conflict. This is why it’s crucial to choose wisely: every single\\nmember of your board matters. Even one problem director will cause you pain, and\\nmay even jeopardize your company’s future.\\nA board of three is ideal. Your board should never exceed five people, unless your\\ncompany is publicly held. (Government regulations effectively mandate that public\\ncompanies have larger boards—the average is nine members.) By far the worst you\\ncan do is to make your board extra large. When unsavvy observers see a nonprofit\\norganization with dozens of people on its board, they think: “Look how many great\\npeople are committed to this organization! It must be extremely well run.” Actually,\\na huge board will exercise no effective oversight at all; it merely provides cover for\\nwhatever microdictator actually runs the organization. If you want that kind of free\\nrein from your board, blow it up to giant size. If you want an effective board, keep it\\nsmall.\\n\\n ON THE BUS OR OFF THE BUS\\nAs a general rule, everyone you involve with your company should be involved fulltime. Sometimes you’ll have to break this rule; it usually makes sense to hire outside\\nlawyers and accountants, for example. However, anyone who doesn’t own stock\\noptions or draw a regular salary from your company is fundamentally misaligned. At\\nthe margin, they’ll be biased to claim value in the near term, not help you create\\nmore in the future. That’s why hiring consultants doesn’t work. Part-time employees\\ndon’t work. Even working remotely should be avoided, because misalignment can\\ncreep in whenever colleagues aren’t together full-time, in the same place, every day.\\nIf you’re deciding whether to bring someone on board, the decision is binary. Ken\\nKesey was right: you’re either on the bus or off the bus.\\n\\n CASH IS NOT KING\\nFor people to be fully committed, they should be properly compensated. Whenever\\nan entrepreneur asks me to invest in his company, I ask him how much he intends to\\npay himself. A company does better the less it pays the CEO—that’s one of the single\\nclearest patterns I’ve noticed from investing in hundreds of startups. In no case\\nshould a CEO of an early-stage, venture-backed startup receive more than $150,000 per\\nyear in salary. It doesn’t matter if he got used to making much more than that at\\nGoogle or if he has a large mortgage and hefty private school tuition bills. If a CEO\\ncollects $300,000 per year, he risks becoming more like a politician than a founder.\\nHigh pay incentivizes him to defend the status quo along with his salary, not to work\\nwith everyone else to surface problems and fix them aggressively. A cash-poor\\nexecutive, by contrast, will focus on increasing the value of the company as a whole.\\nLow CEO pay also sets the standard for everyone else. Aaron Levie, the CEO of\\nBox, was always careful to pay himself less than everyone else in the company—four\\nyears after he started Box, he was still living two blocks away from HQ in a onebedroom apartment with no furniture except a mattress. Every employee noticed his\\nobvious commitment to the company’s mission and emulated it. If a CEO doesn’t set\\nan example by taking the lowest salary in the company, he can do the same thing by\\ndrawing the highest salary. So long as that figure is still modest, it sets an effective\\nceiling on cash compensation.\\nCash is attractive. It offers pure optionality: once you get your paycheck, you can\\ndo anything you want with it. However, high cash compensation teaches workers to\\nclaim value from the company as it already exists instead of investing their time to\\ncreate new value in the future. A cash bonus is slightly better than a cash salary—at\\nleast it’s contingent on a job well done. But even so-called incentive pay encourages\\nshort-term thinking and value grabbing. Any kind of cash is more about the present\\nthan the future.\\n\\n VESTED INTERESTS\\nStartups don’t need to pay high salaries because they can offer something better: part\\nownership of the company itself. Equity is the one form of compensation that can\\neffectively orient people toward creating value in the future.\\nHowever, for equity to create commitment rather than conflict, you must allocate\\nit very carefully. Giving everyone equal shares is usually a mistake: every individual\\nhas different talents and responsibilities as well as different opportunity costs, so\\nequal amounts will seem arbitrary and unfair from the start. On the other hand,\\ngranting different amounts up front is just as sure to seem unfair. Resentment at this\\nstage can kill a company, but there’s no ownership formula to perfectly avoid it.\\nThis problem becomes even more acute over time as more people join the\\ncompany. Early employees usually get the most equity because they take more risk,\\nbut some later employees might be even more crucial to a venture’s success. A\\nsecretary who joined eBay in 1996 might have made 200 times more than her\\nindustry-veteran boss who joined in 1999. The graffiti artist who painted Facebook’s\\noffice walls in 2005 got stock that turned out to be worth $200 million, while a\\ntalented engineer who joined in 2010 might have made only $2 million. Since it’s\\nimpossible to achieve perfect fairness when distributing ownership, founders would\\ndo well to keep the details secret. Sending out a company-wide email that lists\\neveryone’s ownership stake would be like dropping a nuclear bomb on your office.\\nMost people don’t want equity at all. At PayPal, we once hired a consultant who\\npromised to help us negotiate lucrative business development deals. The only thing\\nhe ever successfully negotiated was a $5,000 daily cash salary; he refused to accept\\nstock options as payment. Stories of startup chefs becoming millionaires\\nnotwithstanding, people often find equity unattractive. It’s not liquid like cash. It’s\\ntied to one specific company. And if that company doesn’t succeed, it’s worthless.\\nEquity is a powerful tool precisely because of these limitations. Anyone who\\nprefers owning a part of your company to being paid in cash reveals a preference for\\nthe long term and a commitment to increasing your company’s value in the future.\\nEquity can’t create perfect incentives, but it’s the best way for a founder to keep\\neveryone in the company broadly aligned.\\n\\n EXTENDING THE FOUNDING\\nBob Dylan has said that he who is not busy being born is busy dying. If he’s right,\\nbeing born doesn’t happen at just one moment—you might even continue to do it\\nsomehow, poetically at least. The founding moment of a company, however, really\\ndoes happen just once: only at the very start do you have the opportunity to set the\\nrules that will align people toward the creation of value in the future.\\nThe most valuable kind of company maintains an openness to invention that is\\nmost characteristic of beginnings. This leads to a second, less obvious understanding\\nof the founding: it lasts as long as a company is creating new things, and it ends\\nwhen creation stops. If you get the founding moment right, you can do more than\\ncreate a valuable company: you can steer its distant future toward the creation of\\nnew things instead of the stewardship of inherited success. You might even extend\\nits founding indefinitely.\\n\\n 10\\n\\n THE MECHANICS OF MAFIA\\n\\nS\\n\\nTART WITH A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT: what would the ideal company culture look\\n\\nlike? Employees should love their work. They should enjoy going to the office so\\nmuch that formal business hours become obsolete and nobody watches the clock. The\\nworkspace should be open, not cubicled, and workers should feel at home: beanbag\\nchairs and Ping-Pong tables might outnumber file cabinets. Free massages, on-site\\nsushi chefs, and maybe even yoga classes would sweeten the scene. Pets should be\\nwelcome, too: perhaps employees’ dogs and cats could come and join the office’s\\ntankful of tropical fish as unofficial company mascots.\\nWhat’s wrong with this picture? It includes some of the absurd perks Silicon\\nValley has made famous, but none of the substance—and without substance perks\\ndon’t work. You can’t accomplish anything meaningful by hiring an interior\\ndecorator to beautify your office, a “human resources” consultant to fix your policies,\\nor a branding specialist to hone your buzzwords. “Company culture” doesn’t exist\\napart from the company itself: no company has a culture; every company is a culture.\\nA startup is a team of people on a mission, and a good culture is just what that looks\\nlike on the inside.\\n\\n BEYOND PROFESSIONALISM\\nThe first team that I built has become known in Silicon Valley as the “PayPal\\nMafia” because so many of my former colleagues have gone on to help each other\\nstart and invest in successful tech companies. We sold PayPal to eBay for $1.5 billion\\nin 2002. Since then, Elon Musk has founded SpaceX and co-founded Tesla Motors;\\nReid Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn; Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim\\ntogether founded YouTube; Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons founded Yelp;\\nDavid Sacks co-founded Yammer; and I co-founded Palantir. Today all seven of\\nthose companies are worth more than $1 billion each. PayPal’s office amenities\\nnever got much press, but the team has done extraordinarily well, both together and\\nindividually: the culture was strong enough to transcend the original company.\\nWe didn’t assemble a mafia by sorting through résumés and simply hiring the\\nmost talented people. I had seen the mixed results of that approach firsthand when I\\nworked at a New York law firm. The lawyers I worked with ran a valuable business,\\nand they were impressive individuals one by one. But the relationships between\\nthem were oddly thin. They spent all day together, but few of them seemed to have\\nmuch to say to each other outside the office. Why work with a group of people who\\ndon’t even like each other? Many seem to think it’s a sacrifice necessary for making\\nmoney. But taking a merely professional view of the workplace, in which free agents\\ncheck in and out on a transactional basis, is worse than cold: it’s not even rational.\\nSince time is your most valuable asset, it’s odd to spend it working with people who\\ndon’t envision any long-term future together. If you can’t count durable relationships\\namong the fruits of your time at work, you haven’t invested your time well—even in\\npurely financial terms.\\nFrom the start, I wanted PayPal to be tightly knit instead of transactional. I\\nthought stronger relationships would make us not just happier and better at work\\nbut also more successful in our careers even beyond PayPal. So we set out to hire\\npeople who would actually enjoy working together. They had to be talented, but\\neven more than that they had to be excited about working specifically with us. That\\nwas the start of the PayPal Mafia.\\n\\n RECRUITING CONSPIRATORS\\nRecruiting is a core competency for any company. It should never be outsourced.\\nYou need people who are not just skilled on paper but who will work together\\ncohesively after they’re hired. The first four or five might be attracted by large\\nequity stakes or high-profile responsibilities. More important than those obvious\\nofferings is your answer to this question: Why should the 20th employee join your\\ncompany?\\nTalented people don’t need to work for you; they have plenty of options. You\\nshould ask yourself a more pointed version of the question: Why would someone join\\nyour company as its 20th engineer when she could go work at Google for more money\\nand more prestige?\\nHere are some bad answers: “Your stock options will be worth more here than\\nelsewhere.” “You’ll get to work with the smartest people in the world.” “You can\\nhelp solve the world’s most challenging problems.” What’s wrong with valuable\\nstock, smart people, or pressing problems? Nothing—but every company makes these\\nsame claims, so they won’t help you stand out. General and undifferentiated pitches\\ndon’t say anything about why a recruit should join your company instead of many\\nothers.\\nThe only good answers are specific to your company, so you won’t find them in\\nthis book. But there are two general kinds of good answers: answers about your\\nmission and answers about your team. You’ll attract the employees you need if you\\ncan explain why your mission is compelling: not why it’s important in general, but\\nwhy you’re doing something important that no one else is going to get done. That’s\\nthe only thing that can make its importance unique. At PayPal, if you were excited\\nby the idea of creating a new digital currency to replace the U.S. dollar, we wanted to\\ntalk to you; if not, you weren’t the right fit.\\nHowever, even a great mission is not enough. The kind of recruit who would be\\nmost engaged as an employee will also wonder: “Are these the kind of people I want\\nto work with?” You should be able to explain why your company is a unique match\\nfor him personally. And if you can’t do that, he’s probably not the right match.\\nAbove all, don’t fight the perk war. Anybody who would be more powerfully\\nswayed by free laundry pickup or pet day care would be a bad addition to your team.\\n\\n Just cover the basics like health insurance and then promise what no others can: the\\nopportunity to do irreplaceable work on a unique problem alongside great people.\\nYou probably can’t be the Google of 2014 in terms of compensation or perks, but you\\ncan be like the Google of 1999 if you already have good answers about your mission\\nand team.\\n\\n WHAT’S UNDER SILICON VALLEY’S HOODIES\\nFrom the outside, everyone in your company should be different in the same way.\\nUnlike people on the East Coast, who all wear the same skinny jeans or pinstripe\\nsuits depending on their industry, young people in Mountain View and Palo Alto go\\nto work wearing T-shirts. It’s a cliché that tech workers don’t care about what they\\nwear, but if you look closely at those T-shirts, you’ll see the logos of the wearers’\\ncompanies—and tech workers care about those very much. What makes a startup\\nemployee instantly distinguishable to outsiders is the branded T-shirt or hoodie that\\nmakes him look the same as his co-workers. The startup uniform encapsulates a\\nsimple but essential principle: everyone at your company should be different in the\\nsame way—a tribe of like-minded people fiercely devoted to the company’s mission.\\nMax Levchin, my co-founder at PayPal, says that startups should make their early\\nstaff as personally similar as possible. Startups have limited resources and small\\nteams. They must work quickly and efficiently in order to survive, and that’s easier\\nto do when everyone shares an understanding of the world. The early PayPal team\\nworked well together because we were all the same kind of nerd. We all loved\\nscience fiction: Cryptonomicon was required reading, and we preferred the capitalist\\nStar Wars to the communist Star Trek. Most important, we were all obsessed with\\ncreating a digital currency that would be controlled by individuals instead of\\ngovernments. For the company to work, it didn’t matter what people looked like or\\nwhich country they came from, but we needed every new hire to be equally obsessed.\\n\\n DO ONE THING\\nOn the inside, every individual should be sharply distinguished by her work.\\nWhen assigning responsibilities to employees in a startup, you could start by\\ntreating it as a simple optimization problem to efficiently match talents with tasks.\\nBut even if you could somehow get this perfectly right, any given solution would\\nquickly break down. Partly that’s because startups have to move fast, so individual\\nroles can’t remain static for long. But it’s also because job assignments aren’t just\\nabout the relationships between workers and tasks; they’re also about relationships\\nbetween employees.\\nThe best thing I did as a manager at PayPal was to make every person in the\\ncompany responsible for doing just one thing. Every employee’s one thing was\\nunique, and everyone knew I would evaluate him only on that one thing. I had\\nstarted doing this just to simplify the task of managing people. But then I noticed a\\ndeeper result: defining roles reduced conflict. Most fights inside a company happen\\nwhen colleagues compete for the same responsibilities. Startups face an especially\\nhigh risk of this since job roles are fluid at the early stages. Eliminating competition\\nmakes it easier for everyone to build the kinds of long-term relationships that\\ntranscend mere professionalism. More than that, internal peace is what enables a\\nstartup to survive at all. When a startup fails, we often imagine it succumbing to\\npredatory rivals in a competitive ecosystem. But every company is also its own\\necosystem, and factional strife makes it vulnerable to outside threats. Internal\\nconflict is like an autoimmune disease: the technical cause of death may be\\npneumonia, but the real cause remains hidden from plain view.\\n\\n OF CULTS AND CONSULTANTS\\nIn the most intense kind of organization, members hang out only with other\\nmembers. They ignore their families and abandon the outside world. In exchange,\\nthey experience strong feelings of belonging, and maybe get access to esoteric\\n“truths” denied to ordinary people. We have a word for such organizations: cults.\\nCultures of total dedication look crazy from the outside, partly because the most\\nnotorious cults were homicidal: Jim Jones and Charles Manson did not make good\\nexits.\\nBut entrepreneurs should take cultures of extreme dedication seriously. Is a\\nlukewarm attitude to one’s work a sign of mental health? Is a merely professional\\nattitude the only sane approach? The extreme opposite of a cult is a consulting firm\\nlike Accenture: not only does it lack a distinctive mission of its own, but individual\\nconsultants are regularly dropping in and out of companies to which they have no\\nlong-term connection whatsoever.\\nEvery company culture can be plotted on a linear spectrum:\\n\\nThe best startups might be considered slightly less extreme kinds of cults. The\\nbiggest difference is that cults tend to be fanatically wrong about something\\nimportant. People at a successful startup are fanatically right about something those\\noutside it have missed. You’re not going to learn those kinds of secrets from\\nconsultants, and you don’t need to worry if your company doesn’t make sense to\\nconventional professionals. Better to be called a cult—or even a mafia.\\n\\n 11\\n\\n IF YOU BUILD IT, WILL THEY COME?\\n\\nE\\n\\nVEN THOUGH SALES is everywhere, most people underrate its importance. Silicon\\n\\nValley underrates it more than most. The geek classic The Hitchhiker’s Guide to\\nthe Galaxy even explains the founding of our planet as a reaction against salesmen.\\nWhen an imminent catastrophe requires the evacuation of humanity’s original\\nhome, the population escapes on three giant ships. The thinkers, leaders, and\\nachievers take the A Ship; the salespeople and consultants get the B Ship; and the\\nworkers and artisans take the C Ship. The B Ship leaves first, and all its passengers\\nrejoice vainly. But the salespeople don’t realize they are caught in a ruse: the A Ship\\nand C Ship people had always thought that the B Ship people were useless, so they\\nconspired to get rid of them. And it was the B Ship that landed on Earth.\\nDistribution may not matter in fictional worlds, but it matters in ours. We\\nunderestimate the importance of distribution—a catchall term for everything it\\ntakes to sell a product—because we share the same bias the A Ship and C Ship\\npeople had: salespeople and other “middlemen” supposedly get in the way, and\\ndistribution should flow magically from the creation of a good product. The Field of\\nDreams conceit is especially popular in Silicon Valley, where engineers are biased\\ntoward building cool stuff rather than selling it. But customers will not come just\\nbecause you build it. You have to make that happen, and it’s harder than it looks.\\n\\n NERDS VS. SALESMEN\\nThe U.S. advertising industry collects annual revenues of $150 billion and employs\\nmore than 600,000 people. At $450 billion annually, the U.S. sales industry is even\\nbigger. When they hear that 3.2 million Americans work in sales, seasoned\\nexecutives will suspect the number is low, but engineers may sigh in bewilderment.\\nWhat could that many salespeople possibly be doing?\\nIn Silicon Valley, nerds are skeptical of advertising, marketing, and sales because\\nthey seem superficial and irrational. But advertising matters because it works. It\\nworks on nerds, and it works on you. You may think that you’re an exception; that\\nyour preferences are authentic, and advertising only works on other people. It’s easy\\nto resist the most obvious sales pitches, so we entertain a false confidence in our own\\nindependence of mind. But advertising doesn’t exist to make you buy a product right\\naway; it exists to embed subtle impressions that will drive sales later. Anyone who\\ncan’t acknowledge its likely effect on himself is doubly deceived.\\nNerds are used to transparency. They add value by becoming expert at a technical\\nskill like computer programming. In engineering disciplines, a solution either works\\nor it fails. You can evaluate someone else’s work with relative ease, as surface\\nappearances don’t matter much. Sales is the opposite: an orchestrated campaign to\\nchange surface appearances without changing the underlying reality. This strikes\\nengineers as trivial if not fundamentally dishonest. They know their own jobs are\\nhard, so when they look at salespeople laughing on the phone with a customer or\\ngoing to two-hour lunches, they suspect that no real work is being done. If anything,\\npeople overestimate the relative difficulty of science and engineering, because the\\nchallenges of those fields are obvious. What nerds miss is that it takes hard work to\\nmake sales look easy.\\n\\n SALES IS HIDDEN\\nAll salesmen are actors: their priority is persuasion, not sincerity. That’s why the\\nword “salesman” can be a slur and the used car dealer is our archetype of shadiness.\\nBut we only react negatively to awkward, obvious salesmen—that is, the bad ones.\\nThere’s a wide range of sales ability: there are many gradations between novices,\\nexperts, and masters. There are even sales grandmasters. If you don’t know any\\ngrandmasters, it’s not because you haven’t encountered them, but rather because\\ntheir art is hidden in plain sight. Tom Sawyer managed to persuade his\\nneighborhood friends to whitewash the fence for him—a masterful move. But\\nconvincing them to actually pay him for the privilege of doing his chores was the\\nmove of a grandmaster, and his friends were none the wiser. Not much has changed\\nsince Twain wrote in 1876.\\nLike acting, sales works best when hidden. This explains why almost everyone\\nwhose job involves distribution—whether they’re in sales, marketing, or advertising\\n—has a job title that has nothing to do with those things. People who sell advertising\\nare called “account executives.” People who sell customers work in “business\\ndevelopment.” People who sell companies are “investment bankers.” And people\\nwho sell themselves are called “politicians.” There’s a reason for these redescriptions:\\nnone of us wants to be reminded when we’re being sold.\\nWhatever the career, sales ability distinguishes superstars from also-rans. On Wall\\nStreet, a new hire starts as an “analyst” wielding technical expertise, but his goal is\\nto become a dealmaker. A lawyer prides himself on professional credentials, but law\\nfirms are led by the rainmakers who bring in big clients. Even university professors,\\nwho claim authority from scholarly achievement, are envious of the self-promoters\\nwho define their fields. Academic ideas about history or English don’t just sell\\nthemselves on their intellectual merits. Even the agenda of fundamental physics and\\nthe future path of cancer research are results of persuasion. The most fundamental\\nreason that even businesspeople underestimate the importance of sales is the\\nsystematic effort to hide it at every level of every field in a world secretly driven by\\nit.\\nThe engineer’s grail is a product great enough that “it sells itself.” But anyone\\nwho would actually say this about a real product must be lying: either he’s delusional\\n\\n (lying to himself) or he’s selling something (and thereby contradicting himself). The\\npolar opposite business cliché warns that “the best product doesn’t always win.”\\nEconomists attribute this to “path dependence”: specific historical circumstances\\nindependent of objective quality can determine which products enjoy widespread\\nadoption. That’s true, but it doesn’t mean the operating systems we use today and the\\nkeyboard layouts on which we type were imposed by mere chance. It’s better to\\nthink of distribution as something essential to the design of your product. If you’ve\\ninvented something new but you haven’t invented an effective way to sell it, you\\nhave a bad business—no matter how good the product.\\n\\n HOW TO SELL A PRODUCT\\nSuperior sales and distribution by itself can create a monopoly, even with no product\\ndifferentiation. The converse is not true. No matter how strong your product—even\\nif it easily fits into already established habits and anybody who tries it likes it\\nimmediately—you must still support it with a strong distribution plan.\\nTwo metrics set the limits for effective distribution. The total net profit that you\\nearn on average over the course of your relationship with a customer (Customer\\nLifetime Value, or CLV) must exceed the amount you spend on average to acquire a\\nnew customer (Customer Acquisition Cost, or CAC). In general, the higher the price\\nof your product, the more you have to spend to make a sale—and the more it makes\\nsense to spend it. Distribution methods can be plotted on a continuum:\\n\\nComplex Sales\\nIf your average sale is seven figures or more, every detail of every deal requires close\\npersonal attention. It might take months to develop the right relationships. You\\nmight make a sale only once every year or two. Then you’ll usually have to follow up\\nduring installation and service the product long after the deal is done. It’s hard to do,\\nbut this kind of “complex sales” is the only way to sell some of the most valuable\\nproducts.\\nSpaceX shows that it can be done. Within just a few years of launching his rocket\\nstartup, Elon Musk persuaded NASA to sign billion-dollar contracts to replace the\\ndecommissioned space shuttle with a newly designed vessel from SpaceX. Politics\\nmatters in big deals just as much as technological ingenuity, so this wasn’t easy.\\n\\n SpaceX employs more than 3,000 people, mostly in California. The traditional U.S.\\naerospace industry employs more than 500,000 people, spread throughout all 50\\nstates. Unsurprisingly, members of Congress don’t want to give up federal funds\\ngoing to their home districts. But since complex sales requires making just a few\\ndeals each year, a sales grandmaster like Elon Musk can use that time to focus on the\\nmost crucial people—and even to overcome political inertia.\\nComplex sales works best when you don’t have “salesmen” at all. Palantir, the\\ndata analytics company I co-founded with my law school classmate Alex Karp,\\ndoesn’t employ anyone separately tasked with selling its product. Instead, Alex, who\\nis Palantir’s CEO, spends 25 days a month on the road, meeting with clients and\\npotential clients. Our deal sizes range from $1 million to $100 million. At that price\\npoint, buyers want to talk to the CEO, not the VP of Sales.\\nBusinesses with complex sales models succeed if they achieve 50% to 100% yearover-year growth over the course of a decade. This will seem slow to any\\nentrepreneur dreaming of viral growth. You might expect revenue to increase 10x as\\nsoon as customers learn about an obviously superior product, but that almost never\\nhappens. Good enterprise sales strategy starts small, as it must: a new customer\\nmight agree to become your biggest customer, but they’ll rarely be comfortable\\nsigning a deal completely out of scale with what you’ve sold before. Once you have a\\npool of reference customers who are successfully using your product, then you can\\nbegin the long and methodical work of hustling toward ever bigger deals.\\n\\nPersonal Sales\\nMost sales are not particularly complex: average deal sizes might range between\\n$10,000 and $100,000, and usually the CEO won’t have to do all the selling himself.\\nThe challenge here isn’t about how to make any particular sale, but how to establish\\na process by which a sales team of modest size can move the product to a wide\\naudience.\\nIn 2008, Box had a good way for companies to store their data safely and\\naccessibly in the cloud. But people didn’t know they needed such a thing—cloud\\ncomputing hadn’t caught on yet. That summer, Blake was hired as Box’s third\\nsalesperson to help change that. Starting with small groups of users who had the\\nmost acute file sharing problems, Box’s sales reps built relationships with more and\\nmore users in each client company. In 2009, Blake sold a small Box account to the\\nStanford Sleep Clinic, where researchers needed an easy, secure way to store\\nexperimental data logs. Today the university offers a Stanford-branded Box account\\n\\n to every one of its students and faculty members, and Stanford Hospital runs on Box.\\nIf it had started off by trying to sell the president of the university on an enterprisewide solution, Box would have sold nothing. A complex sales approach would have\\nmade Box a forgotten startup failure; instead, personal sales made it a multibilliondollar business.\\nSometimes the product itself is a kind of distribution. ZocDoc is a Founders Fund\\nportfolio company that helps people find and book medical appointments online.\\nThe company charges doctors a few hundred dollars per month to be included in its\\nnetwork. With an average deal size of just a few thousand dollars, ZocDoc needs lots\\nof salespeople—so many that they have an internal recruiting team to do nothing\\nbut hire more. But making personal sales to doctors doesn’t just bring in revenue; by\\nadding doctors to the network, salespeople make the product more valuable to\\nconsumers (and more consumer users increases its appeal to doctors). More than 5\\nmillion people already use the service each month, and if it can continue to scale its\\nnetwork to include a majority of practitioners, it will become a fundamental utility\\nfor the U.S. health care industry.\\n\\nDistribution Doldrums\\nIn between personal sales (salespeople obviously required) and traditional\\nadvertising (no salespeople required) there is a dead zone. Suppose you create a\\nsoftware service that helps convenience store owners track their inventory and\\nmanage ordering. For a product priced around $1,000, there might be no good\\ndistribution channel to reach the small businesses that might buy it. Even if you\\nhave a clear value proposition, how do you get people to hear it? Advertising would\\neither be too broad (there’s no TV channel that only convenience store owners\\nwatch) or too inefficient (on its own, an ad in Convenience Store News probably won’t\\nconvince any owner to part with $1,000 a year). The product needs a personal sales\\neffort, but at that price point, you simply don’t have the resources to send an actual\\nperson to talk to every prospective customer. This is why so many small and\\nmedium-sized businesses don’t use tools that bigger firms take for granted. It’s not\\nthat small business proprietors are unusually backward or that good tools don’t exist:\\ndistribution is the hidden bottleneck.\\n\\nMarketing and Advertising\\nMarketing and advertising work for relatively low-priced products that have mass\\n\\n appeal but lack any method of viral distribution. Procter & Gamble can’t afford to\\npay salespeople to go door-to-door selling laundry detergent. (P&G does employ\\nsalespeople to talk to grocery chains and large retail outlets, since one detergent sale\\nmade to these buyers might mean 100,000 one-gallon bottles.) To reach its end user,\\na packaged goods company has to produce television commercials, print coupons in\\nnewspapers, and design its product boxes to attract attention.\\nAdvertising can work for startups, too, but only when your customer acquisition\\ncosts and customer lifetime value make every other distribution channel\\nuneconomical. Consider e-commerce startup Warby Parker, which designs and sells\\nfashionable prescription eyeglasses online instead of contracting sales out to retail\\neyewear distributors. Each pair starts at around $100, so assuming the average\\ncustomer buys a few pairs in her lifetime, the company’s CLV is a few hundred\\ndollars. That’s too little to justify personal attention on every transaction, but at the\\nother extreme, hundred-dollar physical products don’t exactly go viral. By running\\nadvertisements and creating quirky TV commercials, Warby is able to get its better,\\nless expensive offerings in front of millions of eyeglass-wearing customers. The\\ncompany states plainly on its website that “TV is a great big megaphone,” and when\\nyou can only afford to spend dozens of dollars acquiring a new customer, you need\\nthe biggest megaphone you can find.\\nEvery entrepreneur envies a recognizable ad campaign, but startups should resist\\nthe temptation to compete with bigger companies in the endless contest to put on the\\nmost memorable TV spots or the most elaborate PR stunts. I know this from\\nexperience. At PayPal we hired James Doohan, who played Scotty on Star Trek, to be\\nour official spokesman. When we released our first software for the PalmPilot, we\\ninvited journalists to an event where they could hear James recite this immortal line:\\n“I’ve been beaming people up my whole career, but this is the first time I’ve ever\\nbeen able to beam money!” It flopped—the few who actually came to cover the\\nevent weren’t impressed. We were all nerds, so we had thought Scotty the Chief\\nEngineer could speak with more authority than, say, Captain Kirk. (Just like a\\nsalesman, Kirk was always showboating out in some exotic locale and leaving it up to\\nthe engineers to bail him out of his own mistakes.) We were wrong: when\\nPriceline.com cast William Shatner (the actor who played Kirk) in a famous series of\\nTV spots, it worked for them. But by then Priceline was a major player. No earlystage startup can match big companies’ advertising budgets. Captain Kirk truly is in\\na league of his own.\\n\\n Viral Marketing\\nA product is viral if its core functionality encourages users to invite their friends to\\nbecome users too. This is how Facebook and PayPal both grew quickly: every time\\nsomeone shares with a friend or makes a payment, they naturally invite more and\\nmore people into the network. This isn’t just cheap—it’s fast, too. If every new user\\nleads to more than one additional user, you can achieve a chain reaction of\\nexponential growth. The ideal viral loop should be as quick and frictionless as\\npossible. Funny YouTube videos or internet memes get millions of views very\\nquickly because they have extremely short cycle times: people see the kitten, feel\\nwarm inside, and forward it to their friends in a matter of seconds.\\nAt PayPal, our initial user base was 24 people, all of whom worked at PayPal.\\nAcquiring customers through banner advertising proved too expensive. However, by\\ndirectly paying people to sign up and then paying them more to refer friends, we\\nachieved extraordinary growth. This strategy cost us $20 per customer, but it also led\\nto 7% daily growth, which meant that our user base nearly doubled every 10 days.\\nAfter four or five months, we had hundreds of thousands of users and a viable\\nopportunity to build a great company by servicing money transfers for small fees\\nthat ended up greatly exceeding our customer acquisition cost.\\nWhoever is first to dominate the most important segment of a market with viral\\npotential will be the last mover in the whole market. At PayPal we didn’t want to\\nacquire more users at random; we wanted to get the most valuable users first. The\\nmost obvious market segment in email-based payments was the millions of\\nemigrants still using Western Union to wire money to their families back home. Our\\nproduct made that effortless, but the transactions were too infrequent. We needed a\\nsmaller niche market segment with a higher velocity of money—a segment we\\nfound in eBay “PowerSellers,” the professional vendors who sold goods online\\nthrough eBay’s auction marketplace. There were 20,000 of them. Most had multiple\\nauctions ending each day, and they bought almost as much as they sold, which\\nmeant a constant stream of payments. And because eBay’s own solution to the\\npayment problem was terrible, these merchants were extremely enthusiastic early\\nadopters. Once PayPal dominated this segment and became the payments platform\\nfor eBay, there was no catching up—on eBay or anywhere else.\\n\\nThe Power Law of Distribution\\nOne of these methods is likely to be far more powerful than every other for any\\n\\n given business: distribution follows a power law of its own. This is counterintuitive\\nfor most entrepreneurs, who assume that more is more. But the kitchen sink\\napproach—employ a few salespeople, place some magazine ads, and try to add some\\nkind of viral functionality to the product as an afterthought—doesn’t work. Most\\nbusinesses get zero distribution channels to work: poor sales rather than bad product\\nis the most common cause of failure. If you can get just one distribution channel to\\nwork, you have a great business. If you try for several but don’t nail one, you’re\\nfinished.\\n\\nSelling to Non-Customers\\nYour company needs to sell more than its product. You must also sell your company\\nto employees and investors. There is a “human resources” version of the lie that\\ngreat products sell themselves: “This company is so good that people will be\\nclamoring to join it.” And there’s a fundraising version too: “This company is so\\ngreat that investors will be banging down our door to invest.” Clamor and frenzy are\\nvery real, but they rarely happen without calculated recruiting and pitching beneath\\nthe surface.\\nSelling your company to the media is a necessary part of selling it to everyone\\nelse. Nerds who instinctively mistrust the media often make the mistake of trying to\\nignore it. But just as you can never expect people to buy a superior product merely on\\nits obvious merits without any distribution strategy, you should never assume that\\npeople will admire your company without a public relations strategy. Even if your\\nparticular product doesn’t need media exposure to acquire customers because you\\nhave a viral distribution strategy, the press can help attract investors and employees.\\nAny prospective employee worth hiring will do his own diligence; what he finds or\\ndoesn’t find when he googles you will be critical to the success of your company.\\n\\n EVERYBODY SELLS\\nNerds might wish that distribution could be ignored and salesmen banished to\\nanother planet. All of us want to believe that we make up our own minds, that sales\\ndoesn’t work on us. But it’s not true. Everybody has a product to sell—no matter\\nwhether you’re an employee, a founder, or an investor. It’s true even if your\\ncompany consists of just you and your computer. Look around. If you don’t see any\\nsalespeople, you’re the salesperson.\\n\\n 12\\n\\n MAN AND MACHINE\\n\\nA\\n\\nS MATURE INDUSTRIES stagnate, information technology has advanced so rapidly\\n\\nthat it has now become synonymous with “technology” itself. Today, more\\nthan 1.5 billion people enjoy instant access to the world’s knowledge using pocketsized devices. Every one of today’s smartphones has thousands of times more\\nprocessing power than the computers that guided astronauts to the moon. And if\\nMoore’s law continues apace, tomorrow’s computers will be even more powerful.\\nComputers already have enough power to outperform people in activities we used\\nto think of as distinctively human. In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated world chess\\nchampion Garry Kasparov. Jeopardy!’s best-ever contestant, Ken Jennings,\\nsuccumbed to IBM’s Watson in 2011. And Google’s self-driving cars are already on\\nCalifornia roads today. Dale Earnhardt Jr. needn’t feel threatened by them, but the\\nGuardian worries (on behalf of the millions of chauffeurs and cabbies in the world)\\nthat self-driving cars “could drive the next wave of unemployment.”\\nEveryone expects computers to do more in the future—so much more that some\\nwonder: 30 years from now, will there be anything left for people to do? “Software is\\neating the world,” venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has announced with a tone of\\ninevitability. VC Andy Kessler sounds almost gleeful when he explains that the best\\nway to create productivity is “to get rid of people.” Forbes captured a more anxious\\nattitude when it asked readers: Will a machine replace you?\\nFuturists can seem like they hope the answer is yes. Luddites are so worried about\\nbeing replaced that they would rather we stop building new technology altogether.\\nNeither side questions the premise that better computers will necessarily replace\\nhuman workers. But that premise is wrong: computers are complements for humans,\\nnot substitutes. The most valuable businesses of coming decades will be built by\\nentrepreneurs who seek to empower people rather than try to make them obsolete.\\n\\n SUBSTITUTION VS. COMPLEMENTARITY\\nFifteen years ago, American workers were worried about competition from cheaper\\nMexican substitutes. And that made sense, because humans really can substitute for\\neach other. Today people think they can hear Ross Perot’s “giant sucking sound”\\nonce more, but they trace it back to server farms somewhere in Texas instead of cutrate factories in Tijuana. Americans fear technology in the near future because they\\nsee it as a replay of the globalization of the near past. But the situations are very\\ndifferent: people compete for jobs and for resources; computers compete for neither.\\n\\nGlobalization Means Substitution\\nWhen Perot warned about foreign competition, both George H. W. Bush and Bill\\nClinton preached the gospel of free trade: since every person has a relative strength\\nat some particular job, in theory the economy maximizes wealth when people\\nspecialize according to their advantages and then trade with each other. In practice,\\nit’s not unambiguously clear how well free trade has worked, for many workers at\\nleast. Gains from trade are greatest when there’s a big discrepancy in comparative\\nadvantage, but the global supply of workers willing to do repetitive tasks for an\\nextremely small wage is extremely large.\\nPeople don’t just compete to supply labor; they also demand the same resources.\\nWhile American consumers have benefited from access to cheap toys and textiles\\nfrom China, they’ve had to pay higher prices for the gasoline newly desired by\\nmillions of Chinese motorists. Whether people eat shark fins in Shanghai or fish\\ntacos in San Diego, they all need food and they all need shelter. And desire doesn’t\\nstop at subsistence—people will demand ever more as globalization continues. Now\\nthat millions of Chinese peasants can finally enjoy a secure supply of basic calories,\\nthey want more of them to come from pork instead of just grain. The convergence of\\ndesire is even more obvious at the top: all oligarchs have the same taste in Cristal,\\nfrom Petersburg to Pyongyang.\\n\\nTechnology Means Complementarity\\n\\n Now think about the prospect of competition from computers instead of competition\\nfrom human workers. On the supply side, computers are far more different from\\npeople than any two people are different from each other: men and machines are\\ngood at fundamentally different things. People have intentionality—we form plans\\nand make decisions in complicated situations. We’re less good at making sense of\\nenormous amounts of data. Computers are exactly the opposite: they excel at\\nefficient data processing, but they struggle to make basic judgments that would be\\nsimple for any human.\\nTo understand the scale of this variance, consider another of Google’s computerfor-human substitution projects. In 2012, one of their supercomputers made\\nheadlines when, after scanning 10 million thumbnails of YouTube videos, it learned\\nto identify a cat with 75% accuracy. That seems impressive—until you remember\\nthat an average four-year-old can do it flawlessly. When a cheap laptop beats the\\nsmartest mathematicians at some tasks but even a supercomputer with 16,000 CPUs\\ncan’t beat a child at others, you can tell that humans and computers are not just more\\nor less powerful than each other—they’re categorically different.\\n\\nThe stark differences between man and machine mean that gains from working\\nwith computers are much higher than gains from trade with other people. We don’t\\n\\n trade with computers any more than we trade with livestock or lamps. And that’s the\\npoint: computers are tools, not rivals.\\nThe differences are even deeper on the demand side. Unlike people in\\nindustrializing countries, computers don’t yearn for more luxurious foods or\\nbeachfront villas in Cap Ferrat; all they require is a nominal amount of electricity,\\nwhich they’re not even smart enough to want. When we design new computer\\ntechnology to help solve problems, we get all the efficiency gains of a\\nhyperspecialized trading partner without having to compete with it for resources.\\nProperly understood, technology is the one way for us to escape competition in a\\nglobalizing world. As computers become more and more powerful, they won’t be\\nsubstitutes for humans: they’ll be complements.\\n\\n COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES\\nComplementarity between computers and humans isn’t just a macro-scale fact. It’s\\nalso the path to building a great business. I came to understand this from my\\nexperience at PayPal. In mid-2000, we had survived the dot-com crash and we were\\ngrowing fast, but we faced one huge problem: we were losing upwards of $10 million\\nto credit card fraud every month. Since we were processing hundreds or even\\nthousands of transactions per minute, we couldn’t possibly review each one—no\\nhuman quality control team could work that fast.\\nSo we did what any group of engineers would do: we tried to automate a solution.\\nFirst, Max Levchin assembled an elite team of mathematicians to study the\\nfraudulent transfers in detail. Then we took what we learned and wrote software to\\nautomatically identify and cancel bogus transactions in real time. But it quickly\\nbecame clear that this approach wouldn’t work either: after an hour or two, the\\nthieves would catch on and change their tactics. We were dealing with an adaptive\\nenemy, and our software couldn’t adapt in response.\\nThe fraudsters’ adaptive evasions fooled our automatic detection algorithms, but\\nwe found that they didn’t fool our human analysts as easily. So Max and his\\nengineers rewrote the software to take a hybrid approach: the computer would flag\\nthe most suspicious transactions on a well-designed user interface, and human\\noperators would make the final judgment as to their legitimacy. Thanks to this\\nhybrid system—we named it “Igor,” after the Russian fraudster who bragged that\\nwe’d never be able to stop him—we turned our first quarterly profit in the first\\nquarter of 2002 (as opposed to a quarterly loss of $29.3 million one year before). The\\nFBI asked us if we’d let them use Igor to help detect financial crime. And Max was\\nable to boast, grandiosely but truthfully, that he was “the Sherlock Holmes of the\\nInternet Underground.”\\nThis kind of man-machine symbiosis enabled PayPal to stay in business, which in\\nturn enabled hundreds of thousands of small businesses to accept the payments they\\nneeded to thrive on the internet. None of it would have been possible without the\\nman-machine solution—even though most people would never see it or even hear\\nabout it.\\nI continued to think about this after we sold PayPal in 2002: if humans and\\n\\n computers together could achieve dramatically better results than either could attain\\nalone, what other valuable businesses could be built on this core principle? The next\\nyear, I pitched Alex Karp, an old Stanford classmate, and Stephen Cohen, a software\\nengineer, on a new startup idea: we would use the human-computer hybrid approach\\nfrom PayPal’s security system to identify terrorist networks and financial fraud. We\\nalready knew the FBI was interested, and in 2004 we founded Palantir, a software\\ncompany that helps people extract insight from divergent sources of information.\\nThe company is on track to book sales of $1 billion in 2014, and Forbes has called\\nPalantir’s software the “killer app” for its rumored role in helping the government\\nlocate Osama bin Laden.\\nWe have no details to share from that operation, but we can say that neither\\nhuman intelligence by itself nor computers alone will be able to make us safe.\\nAmerica’s two biggest spy agencies take opposite approaches: The Central\\nIntelligence Agency is run by spies who privilege humans. The National Security\\nAgency is run by generals who prioritize computers. CIA analysts have to wade\\nthrough so much noise that it’s very difficult to identify the most serious threats.\\nNSA computers can process huge quantities of data, but machines alone cannot\\nauthoritatively determine whether someone is plotting a terrorist act. Palantir aims\\nto transcend these opposing biases: its software analyzes the data the government\\nfeeds it—phone records of radical clerics in Yemen or bank accounts linked to terror\\ncell activity, for instance—and flags suspicious activities for a trained analyst to\\nreview.\\nIn addition to helping find terrorists, analysts using Palantir’s software have been\\nable to predict where insurgents plant IEDs in Afghanistan; prosecute high-profile\\ninsider trading cases; take down the largest child pornography ring in the world;\\nsupport the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in fighting foodborne disease\\noutbreaks; and save both commercial banks and the government hundreds of\\nmillions of dollars annually through advanced fraud detection.\\nAdvanced software made this possible, but even more important were the human\\nanalysts, prosecutors, scientists, and financial professionals without whose active\\nengagement the software would have been useless.\\nThink of what professionals do in their jobs today. Lawyers must be able to\\narticulate solutions to thorny problems in several different ways—the pitch changes\\ndepending on whether you’re talking to a client, opposing counsel, or a judge.\\nDoctors need to marry clinical understanding with an ability to communicate it to\\nnon-expert patients. And good teachers aren’t just experts in their disciplines: they\\nmust also understand how to tailor their instruction to different individuals’ interests\\n\\n and learning styles. Computers might be able to do some of these tasks, but they\\ncan’t combine them effectively. Better technology in law, medicine, and education\\nwon’t replace professionals; it will allow them to do even more.\\nLinkedIn has done exactly this for recruiters. When LinkedIn was founded in\\n2003, they didn’t poll recruiters to find discrete pain points in need of relief. And\\nthey didn’t try to write software that would replace recruiters outright. Recruiting is\\npart detective work and part sales: you have to scrutinize applicants’ history, assess\\ntheir motives and compatibility, and persuade the most promising ones to join you.\\nEffectively replacing all those functions with a computer would be impossible.\\nInstead, LinkedIn set out to transform how recruiters did their jobs. Today, more\\nthan 97% of recruiters use LinkedIn and its powerful search and filtering\\nfunctionality to source job candidates, and the network also creates value for the\\nhundreds of millions of professionals who use it to manage their personal brands. If\\nLinkedIn had tried to simply replace recruiters with technology, they wouldn’t have\\na business today.\\n\\nThe Ideology of Computer Science\\nWhy do so many people miss the power of complementarity? It starts in school.\\nSoftware engineers tend to work on projects that replace human efforts because\\nthat’s what they’re trained to do. Academics make their reputations through\\nspecialized research; their primary goal is to publish papers, and publication means\\nrespecting the limits of a particular discipline. For computer scientists, that means\\nreducing human capabilities into specialized tasks that computers can be trained to\\nconquer one by one.\\nJust look at the trendiest fields in computer science today. The very term\\n“machine learning” evokes imagery of replacement, and its boosters seem to believe\\nthat computers can be taught to perform almost any task, so long as we feed them\\nenough training data. Any user of Netflix or Amazon has experienced the results of\\nmachine learning firsthand: both companies use algorithms to recommend products\\nbased on your viewing and purchase history. Feed them more data and the\\nrecommendations get ever better. Google Translate works the same way, providing\\nrough but serviceable translations into any of the 80 languages it supports—not\\nbecause the software understands human language, but because it has extracted\\npatterns through statistical analysis of a huge corpus of text.\\nThe other buzzword that epitomizes a bias toward substitution is “big data.”\\nToday’s companies have an insatiable appetite for data, mistakenly believing that\\n\\n more data always creates more value. But big data is usually dumb data. Computers\\ncan find patterns that elude humans, but they don’t know how to compare patterns\\nfrom different sources or how to interpret complex behaviors. Actionable insights\\ncan only come from a human analyst (or the kind of generalized artificial\\nintelligence that exists only in science fiction).\\nWe have let ourselves become enchanted by big data only because we exoticize\\ntechnology. We’re impressed with small feats accomplished by computers alone, but\\nwe ignore big achievements from complementarity because the human contribution\\nmakes them less uncanny. Watson, Deep Blue, and ever-better machine learning\\nalgorithms are cool. But the most valuable companies in the future won’t ask what\\nproblems can be solved with computers alone. Instead, they’ll ask: how can computers\\nhelp humans solve hard problems?\\n\\n EVER-SMARTER COMPUTERS: FRIEND OR FOE?\\nThe future of computing is necessarily full of unknowns. It’s become conventional to\\nsee ever-smarter anthropomorphized robot intelligences like Siri and Watson as\\nharbingers of things to come; once computers can answer all our questions, perhaps\\nthey’ll ask why they should remain subservient to us at all.\\nThe logical endpoint to this substitutionist thinking is called “strong AI”:\\ncomputers that eclipse humans on every important dimension. Of course, the\\nLuddites are terrified by the possibility. It even makes the futurists a little uneasy;\\nit’s not clear whether strong AI would save humanity or doom it. Technology is\\nsupposed to increase our mastery over nature and reduce the role of chance in our\\nlives; building smarter-than-human computers could actually bring chance back\\nwith a vengeance. Strong AI is like a cosmic lottery ticket: if we win, we get utopia;\\nif we lose, Skynet substitutes us out of existence.\\nBut even if strong AI is a real possibility rather than an imponderable mystery, it\\nwon’t happen anytime soon: replacement by computers is a worry for the 22nd\\ncentury. Indefinite fears about the far future shouldn’t stop us from making definite\\nplans today. Luddites claim that we shouldn’t build the computers that might\\nreplace people someday; crazed futurists argue that we should. These two positions\\nare mutually exclusive but they are not exhaustive: there is room in between for sane\\npeople to build a vastly better world in the decades ahead. As we find new ways to\\nuse computers, they won’t just get better at the kinds of things people already do;\\nthey’ll help us to do what was previously unimaginable.\\n\\n13\\n\\n SEEING GREEN\\n\\nA\\n\\nT THE START of the 21st century, everyone agreed that the next big thing was\\n\\nclean technology. It had to be: in Beijing, the smog had gotten so bad that\\npeople couldn’t see from building to building—even breathing was a health risk.\\nBangladesh, with its arsenic-laden water wells, was suffering what the New York\\nTimes called “the biggest mass poisoning in history.” In the U.S., Hurricanes Ivan\\nand Katrina were said to be harbingers of the coming devastation from global\\nwarming. Al Gore implored us to attack these problems “with the urgency and\\nresolve that has previously been seen only when nations mobilized for war.” People\\ngot busy: entrepreneurs started thousands of cleantech companies, and investors\\npoured more than $50 billion into them. So began the quest to cleanse the world.\\nIt didn’t work. Instead of a healthier planet, we got a massive cleantech bubble.\\nSolyndra is the most famous green ghost, but most cleantech companies met\\nsimilarly disastrous ends—more than 40 solar manufacturers went out of business or\\nfiled for bankruptcy in 2012 alone. The leading index of alternative energy\\ncompanies shows the bubble’s dramatic deflation:\\n\\n Why did cleantech fail? Conservatives think they already know the answer: as\\nsoon as green energy became a priority for the government, it was poisoned. But\\nthere really were (and there still are) good reasons for making energy a priority. And\\nthe truth about cleantech is more complex and more important than government\\nfailure. Most cleantech companies crashed because they neglected one or more of the\\nseven questions that every business must answer:\\n1. The Engineering Question\\nCan you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?\\n2. The Timing Question\\nIs now the right time to start your particular business?\\n3. The Monopoly Question\\nAre you starting with a big share of a small market?\\n4. The People Question\\nDo you have the right team?\\n5. The Distribution Question\\nDo you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?\\n6. The Durability Question\\nWill your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?\\n7. The Secret Question\\nHave you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?\\nWe’ve discussed these elements before. Whatever your industry, any great\\nbusiness plan must address every one of them. If you don’t have good answers to\\nthese questions, you’ll run into lots of “bad luck” and your business will fail. If you\\nnail all seven, you’ll master fortune and succeed. Even getting five or six correct\\nmight work. But the striking thing about the cleantech bubble was that people were\\nstarting companies with zero good answers—and that meant hoping for a miracle.\\nIt’s hard to know exactly why any particular cleantech company failed, since\\n\\n almost all of them made several serious mistakes. But since any one of those mistakes\\nis enough to doom your company, it’s worth reviewing cleantech’s losing scorecard in\\nmore detail.\\n\\n THE ENGINEERING QUESTION\\nA great technology company should have proprietary technology an order of\\nmagnitude better than its nearest substitute. But cleantech companies rarely\\nproduced 2x, let alone 10x, improvements. Sometimes their offerings were actually\\nworse than the products they sought to replace. Solyndra developed novel, cylindrical\\nsolar cells, but to a first approximation, cylindrical cells are only 1/π as efficient as\\nflat ones—they simply don’t receive as much direct sunlight. The company tried to\\ncorrect for this deficiency by using mirrors to reflect more sunlight to hit the bottoms\\nof the panels, but it’s hard to recover from a radically inferior starting point.\\nCompanies must strive for 10x better because merely incremental improvements\\noften end up meaning no improvement at all for the end user. Suppose you develop a\\nnew wind turbine that’s 20% more efficient than any existing technology—when\\nyou test it in the laboratory. That sounds good at first, but the lab result won’t begin\\nto compensate for the expenses and risks faced by any new product in the real world.\\nAnd even if your system really is 20% better on net for the customer who buys it,\\npeople are so used to exaggerated claims that you’ll be met with skepticism when\\nyou try to sell it. Only when your product is 10x better can you offer the customer\\ntransparent superiority.\\n\\n THE TIMING QUESTION\\nCleantech entrepreneurs worked hard to convince themselves that their appointed\\nhour had arrived. When he announced his new company in 2008, SpectraWatt CEO\\nAndrew Wilson stated that “[t]he solar industry is akin to where the microprocessor\\nindustry was in the late 1970s. There is a lot to be figured out and improved.” The\\nsecond part was right, but the microprocessor analogy was way off. Ever since the\\nfirst microprocessor was built in 1970, computing advanced not just rapidly but\\nexponentially. Look at Intel’s early product release history:\\n\\nThe first silicon solar cell, by contrast, was created by Bell Labs in 1954—more\\nthan a half century before Wilson’s press release. Photovoltaic efficiency improved in\\nthe intervening decades, but slowly and linearly: Bell’s first solar cell had about 6%\\nefficiency; neither today’s crystalline silicon cells nor modern thin-film cells have\\nexceeded 25% efficiency in the field. There were few engineering developments in\\nthe mid-2000s to suggest impending liftoff. Entering a slow-moving market can be a\\ngood strategy, but only if you have a definite and realistic plan to take it over. The\\nfailed cleantech companies had none.\\n\\n THE MONOPOLY QUESTION\\nIn 2006, billionaire technology investor John Doerr announced that “green is the\\nnew red, white and blue.” He could have stopped at “red.” As Doerr himself said,\\n“Internet-sized markets are in the billions of dollars; the energy markets are in the\\ntrillions.” What he didn’t say is that huge, trillion-dollar markets mean ruthless,\\nbloody competition. Others echoed Doerr over and over: in the 2000s, I listened to\\ndozens of cleantech entrepreneurs begin fantastically rosy PowerPoint presentations\\nwith all-too-true tales of trillion-dollar markets—as if that were a good thing.\\nCleantech executives emphasized the bounty of an energy market big enough for\\nall comers, but each one typically believed that his own company had an edge. In\\n2006, Dave Pearce, CEO of solar manufacturer MiaSolé, admitted to a congressional\\npanel that his company was just one of several “very strong” startups working on one\\nparticular kind of thin-film solar cell development. Minutes later, Pearce predicted\\nthat MiaSolé would become “the largest producer of thin-film solar cells in the\\nworld” within a year’s time. That didn’t happen, but it might not have helped them\\nanyway: thin-film is just one of more than a dozen kinds of solar cells. Customers\\nwon’t care about any particular technology unless it solves a particular problem in a\\nsuperior way. And if you can’t monopolize a unique solution for a small market,\\nyou’ll be stuck with vicious competition. That’s what happened to MiaSolé, which\\nwas acquired in 2013 for hundreds of millions of dollars less than its investors had\\nput into the company.\\nExaggerating your own uniqueness is an easy way to botch the monopoly\\nquestion. Suppose you’re running a solar company that’s successfully installed\\nhundreds of solar panel systems with a combined power generation capacity of 100\\nmegawatts. Since total U.S. solar energy production capacity is 950 megawatts, you\\nown 10.53% of the market. Congratulations, you tell yourself: you’re a player.\\n\\n But what if the U.S. solar energy market isn’t the relevant market? What if the\\nrelevant market is the global solar market, with a production capacity of 18\\ngigawatts? Your 100 megawatts now makes you a very small fish indeed: suddenly\\nyou own less than 1% of the market.\\n\\nAnd what if the appropriate measure isn’t global solar, but rather renewable\\nenergy in general? Annual production capacity from renewables is 420 gigawatts\\nglobally; you just shrank to 0.02% of the market. And compared to the total global\\npower generation capacity of 15,000 gigawatts, your 100 megawatts is just a drop in\\nthe ocean.\\n\\n Cleantech entrepreneurs’ thinking about markets was hopelessly confused. They\\nwould rhetorically shrink their market in order to seem differentiated, only to turn\\naround and ask to be valued based on huge, supposedly lucrative markets. But you\\ncan’t dominate a submarket if it’s fictional, and huge markets are highly\\ncompetitive, not highly attainable. Most cleantech founders would have been better\\noff opening a new British restaurant in downtown Palo Alto.\\n\\n THE PEOPLE QUESTION\\nEnergy problems are engineering problems, so you would expect to find nerds\\nrunning cleantech companies. You’d be wrong: the ones that failed were run by\\nshockingly nontechnical teams. These salesman-executives were good at raising\\ncapital and securing government subsidies, but they were less good at building\\nproducts that customers wanted to buy.\\nAt Founders Fund, we saw this coming. The most obvious clue was sartorial:\\ncleantech executives were running around wearing suits and ties. This was a huge\\nred flag, because real technologists wear T-shirts and jeans. So we instituted a\\nblanket rule: pass on any company whose founders dressed up for pitch meetings.\\nMaybe we still would have avoided these bad investments if we had taken the time\\nto evaluate each company’s technology in detail. But the team insight—never invest\\nin a tech CEO that wears a suit—got us to the truth a lot faster. The best sales is\\nhidden. There’s nothing wrong with a CEO who can sell, but if he actually looks like\\na salesman, he’s probably bad at sales and worse at tech.\\n\\nSolyndra CEO Brian Harrison; Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk\\n\\n THE DISTRIBUTION QUESTION\\nCleantech companies effectively courted government and investors, but they often\\nforgot about customers. They learned the hard way that the world is not a\\nlaboratory: selling and delivering a product is at least as important as the product\\nitself.\\nJust ask Israeli electric vehicle startup Better Place, which from 2007 to 2012\\nraised and spent more than $800 million to build swappable battery packs and\\ncharging stations for electric cars. The company sought to “create a green alternative\\nthat would lessen our dependence on highly polluting transportation technologies.”\\nAnd it did just that—at least by 1,000 cars, the number it sold before filing for\\nbankruptcy. Even selling that many was an achievement, because each of those cars\\nwas very hard for customers to buy.\\nFor starters, it was never clear what you were actually buying. Better Place bought\\nsedans from Renault and refitted them with electric batteries and electric motors. So,\\nwere you buying an electric Renault, or were you buying a Better Place? In any case,\\nif you decided to buy one, you had to jump through a series of hoops. First, you\\nneeded to seek approval from Better Place. To get that, you had to prove that you\\nlived close enough to a Better Place battery swapping station and promise to follow\\npredictable routes. If you passed that test, you had to sign up for a fueling\\nsubscription in order to recharge your car. Only then could you get started learning\\nthe new behavior of stopping to swap out battery packs on the road.\\nBetter Place thought its technology spoke for itself, so they didn’t bother to\\nmarket it clearly. Reflecting on the company’s failure, one frustrated customer asked,\\n“Why wasn’t there a billboard in Tel Aviv showing a picture of a Toyota Prius for\\n160,000 shekels and a picture of this car, for 160,000 plus fuel for four years?” He\\nstill bought one of the cars, but unlike most people, he was a hobbyist who “would\\ndo anything to keep driving it.” Unfortunately, he can’t: as the Better Place board of\\ndirectors stated upon selling the company’s assets for a meager $12 million in 2013,\\n“The technical challenges we overcame successfully, but the other obstacles we were\\nnot able to overcome.”\\n\\n THE DURABILITY QUESTION\\nEvery entrepreneur should plan to be the last mover in her particular market. That\\nstarts with asking yourself: what will the world look like 10 and 20 years from now,\\nand how will my business fit in?\\nFew cleantech companies had a good answer. As a result, all their obituaries\\nresemble each other. A few months before it filed for bankruptcy in 2011, Evergreen\\nSolar explained its decision to close one of its U.S. factories:\\nSolar manufacturers in China have received considerable government and\\nfinancial support.… Although [our] production costs … are now below\\noriginally planned levels and lower than most western manufacturers,\\nthey are still much higher than those of our low cost competitors in China.\\nBut it wasn’t until 2012 that the “blame China” chorus really exploded.\\nDiscussing its bankruptcy filing, U.S. Department of Energy–backed Abound Solar\\nblamed “aggressive pricing actions from Chinese solar panel companies” that “made\\nit very difficult for an early stage startup company … to scale in current market\\nconditions.” When solar panel maker Energy Conversion Devices failed in February\\n2012, it went beyond blaming China in a press release and filed a $950 million\\nlawsuit against three prominent Chinese solar manufacturers—the same companies\\nthat Solyndra’s trustees in bankruptcy sued later that year on the grounds of\\nattempted monopolization, conspiracy, and predatory pricing. But was competition\\nfrom Chinese manufacturers really impossible to predict? Cleantech entrepreneurs\\nwould have done well to rephrase the durability question and ask: what will stop\\nChina from wiping out my business? Without an answer, the result shouldn’t have\\ncome as a surprise.\\nBeyond the failure to anticipate competition in manufacturing the same green\\nproducts, cleantech embraced misguided assumptions about the energy market as a\\nwhole. An industry premised on the supposed twilight of fossil fuels was blindsided\\nby the rise of fracking. In 2000, just 1.7% of America’s natural gas came from\\nfracked shale. Five years later, that figure had climbed to 4.1%. Nevertheless,\\nnobody in cleantech took this trend seriously: renewables were the only way forward;\\n\\n fossil fuels couldn’t possibly get cheaper or cleaner in the future. But they did. By\\n2013, shale gas accounted for 34% of America’s natural gas, and gas prices had fallen\\nmore than 70% since 2008, devastating most renewable energy business models.\\nFracking may not be a durable energy solution, either, but it was enough to doom\\ncleantech companies that didn’t see it coming.\\n\\n THE SECRET QUESTION\\nEvery cleantech company justified itself with conventional truths about the need for\\na cleaner world. They deluded themselves into believing that an overwhelming\\nsocial need for alternative energy solutions implied an overwhelming business\\nopportunity for cleantech companies of all kinds. Consider how conventional it had\\nbecome by 2006 to be bullish on solar. That year, President George W. Bush\\nheralded a future of “solar roofs that will enable the American family to be able to\\ngenerate their own electricity.” Investor and cleantech executive Bill Gross declared\\nthat the “potential for solar is enormous.” Suvi Sharma, then-CEO of solar\\nmanufacturer Solaria, admitted that while “there is a gold rush feeling” to solar,\\n“there’s also real gold here—or, in our case, sunshine.” But rushing to embrace the\\nconvention sent scores of solar panel companies—Q-Cells, Evergreen Solar,\\nSpectraWatt, and even Gross’s own Energy Innovations, to name just a few—from\\npromising beginnings to bankruptcy court very quickly. Each of the casualties had\\ndescribed their bright futures using broad conventions on which everybody agreed.\\nGreat companies have secrets: specific reasons for success that other people don’t see.\\n\\n THE MYTH OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP\\nCleantech entrepreneurs aimed for more than just success as most businesses define\\nit. The cleantech bubble was the biggest phenomenon—and the biggest flop—in the\\nhistory of “social entrepreneurship.” This philanthropic approach to business starts\\nwith the idea that corporations and nonprofits have until now been polar opposites:\\ncorporations have great power, but they’re shackled to the profit motive; nonprofits\\npursue the public interest, but they’re weak players in the wider economy. Social\\nentrepreneurs aim to combine the best of both worlds and “do well by doing good.”\\nUsually they end up doing neither.\\nThe ambiguity between social and financial goals doesn’t help. But the ambiguity\\nin the word “social” is even more of a problem: if something is “socially good,” is it\\ngood for society, or merely seen as good by society? Whatever is good enough to\\nreceive applause from all audiences can only be conventional, like the general idea of\\ngreen energy.\\nProgress isn’t held back by some difference between corporate greed and nonprofit\\ngoodness; instead, we’re held back by the sameness of both. Just as corporations tend\\nto copy each other, nonprofits all tend to push the same priorities. Cleantech shows\\nthe result: hundreds of undifferentiated products all in the name of one overbroad\\ngoal.\\nDoing something different is what’s truly good for society—and it’s also what\\nallows a business to profit by monopolizing a new market. The best projects are\\nlikely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by a crowd; the best problems to work on are\\noften the ones nobody else even tries to solve.\\n\\n TESLA: 7 FOR 7\\nTesla is one of the few cleantech companies started last decade to be thriving today.\\nThey rode the social buzz of cleantech better than anyone, but they got the seven\\nquestions right, so their success is instructive:\\nTECHNOLOGY. Tesla’s technology is so good that other car companies rely\\non it: Daimler uses Tesla’s battery packs; Mercedes-Benz uses a Tesla\\npowertrain; Toyota uses a Tesla motor. General Motors has even created a\\ntask force to track Tesla’s next moves. But Tesla’s greatest technological\\nachievement isn’t any single part or component, but rather its ability to\\nintegrate many components into one superior product. The Tesla Model S\\nsedan, elegantly designed from end to end, is more than the sum of its\\nparts: Consumer Reports rated it higher than any other car ever reviewed,\\nand both Motor Trend and Automobile magazines named it their 2013 Car\\nof the Year.\\nTIMING. In 2009, it was easy to think that the government would continue\\n\\nto support cleantech: “green jobs” were a political priority, federal funds\\nwere already earmarked, and Congress even seemed likely to pass capand-trade legislation. But where others saw generous subsidies that could\\nflow indefinitely, Tesla CEO Elon Musk rightly saw a one-time-only\\nopportunity. In January 2010—about a year and a half before Solyndra\\nimploded under the Obama administration and politicized the subsidy\\nquestion—Tesla secured a $465 million loan from the U.S. Department of\\nEnergy. A half-billion-dollar subsidy was unthinkable in the mid-2000s.\\nIt’s unthinkable today. There was only one moment where that was\\npossible, and Tesla played it perfectly.\\nMONOPOLY. Tesla started with a tiny submarket that it could dominate:\\n\\nthe market for high-end electric sports cars. Since the first Roadster rolled\\noff the production line in 2008, Tesla’s sold only about 3,000 of them, but\\nat $109,000 apiece that’s not trivial. Starting small allowed Tesla to\\nundertake the necessary R&D to build the slightly less expensive Model S,\\n\\n and now Tesla owns the luxury electric sedan market, too. They sold more\\nthan 20,000 sedans in 2013 and now Tesla is in prime position to expand\\nto broader markets in the future.\\nTEAM. Tesla’s CEO is the consummate engineer and salesman, so it’s not\\n\\nsurprising that he’s assembled a team that’s very good at both. Elon\\ndescribes his staff this way: “If you’re at Tesla, you’re choosing to be at the\\nequivalent of Special Forces. There’s the regular army, and that’s fine, but\\nif you are working at Tesla, you’re choosing to step up your game.”\\nDISTRIBUTION. Most companies underestimate distribution, but Tesla took\\n\\nit so seriously that it decided to own the entire distribution chain. Other\\ncar companies are beholden to independent dealerships: Ford and\\nHyundai make cars, but they rely on other people to sell them. Tesla sells\\nand services its vehicles in its own stores. The up-front costs of Tesla’s\\napproach are much higher than traditional dealership distribution, but it\\naffords control over the customer experience, strengthens Tesla’s brand,\\nand saves the company money in the long run.\\nDURABILITY. Tesla has a head start and it’s moving faster than anyone else\\n\\n—and that combination means its lead is set to widen in the years ahead.\\nA coveted brand is the clearest sign of Tesla’s breakthrough: a car is one of\\nthe biggest purchasing decisions that people ever make, and consumers’\\ntrust in that category is hard to win. And unlike every other car company,\\nat Tesla the founder is still in charge, so it’s not going to ease off anytime\\nsoon.\\nSECRETS. Tesla knew that fashion drove interest in cleantech. Rich people\\n\\nespecially wanted to appear “green,” even if it meant driving a boxy Prius\\nor clunky Honda Insight. Those cars only made drivers look cool by\\nassociation with the famous eco-conscious movie stars who owned them as\\nwell. So Tesla decided to build cars that made drivers look cool, period\\n—Leonardo DiCaprio even ditched his Prius for an expensive (and\\nexpensive-looking) Tesla Roadster. While generic cleantech companies\\nstruggled to differentiate themselves, Tesla built a unique brand around\\nthe secret that cleantech was even more of a social phenomenon than an\\nenvironmental imperative.\\n\\n ENERGY 2.0\\nTesla’s success proves that there was nothing inherently wrong with cleantech. The\\nbiggest idea behind it is right: the world really will need new sources of energy.\\nEnergy is the master resource: it’s how we feed ourselves, build shelter, and make\\neverything we need to live comfortably. Most of the world dreams of living as\\ncomfortably as Americans do today, and globalization will cause increasingly severe\\nenergy challenges unless we build new technology. There simply aren’t enough\\nresources in the world to replicate old approaches or redistribute our way to\\nprosperity.\\nCleantech gave people a way to be optimistic about the future of energy. But\\nwhen indefinitely optimistic investors betting on the general idea of green energy\\nfunded cleantech companies that lacked specific business plans, the result was a\\nbubble. Plot the valuation of alternative energy firms in the 2000s alongside the\\nNASDAQ’s rise and fall a decade before, and you see the same shape:\\n\\nThe 1990s had one big idea: the internet is going to be big. But too many internet\\ncompanies had exactly that same idea and no others. An entrepreneur can’t benefit\\nfrom macro-scale insight unless his own plans begin at the micro-scale. Cleantech\\n\\n companies faced the same problem: no matter how much the world needs energy,\\nonly a firm that offers a superior solution for a specific energy problem can make\\nmoney. No sector will ever be so important that merely participating in it will be\\nenough to build a great company.\\nThe tech bubble was far bigger than cleantech and the crash even more painful.\\nBut the dream of the ’90s turned out to be right: skeptics who doubted that the\\ninternet would fundamentally change publishing or retail sales or everyday social\\nlife looked prescient in 2001, but they seem comically foolish today. Could successful\\nenergy startups be founded after the cleantech crash just as Web 2.0 startups\\nsuccessfully launched amid the debris of the dot-coms? The macro need for energy\\nsolutions is still real. But a valuable business must start by finding a niche and\\ndominating a small market. Facebook started as a service for just one university\\ncampus before it spread to other schools and then the entire world. Finding small\\nmarkets for energy solutions will be tricky—you could aim to replace diesel as a\\npower source for remote islands, or maybe build modular reactors for quick\\ndeployment at military installations in hostile territories. Paradoxically, the\\nchallenge for the entrepreneurs who will create Energy 2.0 is to think small.\\n\\n 14\\n\\n THE FOUNDER’S PARADOX\\n\\nO\\n\\nF THE SIX PEOPLE who started PayPal, four had built bombs in high school.\\n\\nFive were just 23 years old—or younger. Four of us had been born outside\\nthe United States. Three had escaped here from communist countries: Yu Pan from\\nChina, Luke Nosek from Poland, and Max Levchin from Soviet Ukraine. Building\\nbombs was not what kids normally did in those countries at that time.\\nThe six of us could have been seen as eccentric. My first-ever conversation with\\nLuke was about how he’d just signed up for cryonics, to be frozen upon death in hope\\nof medical resurrection. Max claimed to be without a country and proud of it: his\\nfamily was put into diplomatic limbo when the USSR collapsed while they were\\nescaping to the U.S. Russ Simmons had escaped from a trailer park to the top math\\nand science magnet school in Illinois. Only Ken Howery fit the stereotype of a\\nprivileged American childhood: he was PayPal’s sole Eagle Scout. But Kenny’s peers\\nthought he was crazy to join the rest of us and make just one-third of the salary he\\nhad been offered by a big bank. So even he wasn’t entirely normal.\\n\\n The PayPal Team in 1999\\n\\nAre all founders unusual people? Or do we just tend to remember and exaggerate\\nwhatever is most unusual about them? More important, which personal traits\\nactually matter in a founder? This chapter is about why it’s more powerful but at the\\nsame time more dangerous for a company to be led by a distinctive individual\\ninstead of an interchangeable manager.\\n\\n THE DIFFERENCE ENGINE\\nSome people are strong, some are weak, some are geniuses, some are dullards—but\\nmost people are in the middle. Plot where everyone falls and you’ll see a bell curve:\\n\\nSince so many founders seem to have extreme traits, you might guess that a plot\\nshowing only founders’ traits would have fatter tails with more people at either end.\\n\\n But that doesn’t capture the strangest thing about founders. Normally we expect\\nopposite traits to be mutually exclusive: a normal person can’t be both rich and poor\\nat the same time, for instance. But it happens all the time to founders: startup CEOs\\ncan be cash poor but millionaires on paper. They may oscillate between sullen\\njerkiness and appealing charisma. Almost all successful entrepreneurs are\\nsimultaneously insiders and outsiders. And when they do succeed, they attract both\\nfame and infamy. When you plot them out, founders’ traits appear to follow an\\ninverse normal distribution:\\n\\n Where does this strange and extreme combination of traits come from? They\\ncould be present from birth (nature) or acquired from an individual’s environment\\n(nurture). But perhaps founders aren’t really as extreme as they appear. Might they\\nstrategically exaggerate certain qualities? Or is it possible that everyone else\\nexaggerates them? All of these effects can be present at the same time, and whenever\\npresent they powerfully reinforce each other. The cycle usually starts with unusual\\npeople and ends with them acting and seeming even more unusual:\\n\\n As an example, take Sir Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of the Virgin\\nGroup. He could be described as a natural entrepreneur: Branson started his first\\nbusiness at age 16, and at just 22 he founded Virgin Records. But other aspects of his\\nrenown—the trademark lion’s mane hairstyle, for example—are less natural: one\\nsuspects he wasn’t born with that exact look. As Branson has cultivated his other\\nextreme traits (Is kiteboarding with naked supermodels a PR stunt? Just a guy\\nhaving fun? Both?), the media has eagerly enthroned him: Branson is “The Virgin\\nKing,” “The Undisputed King of PR,” “The King of Branding,” and “The King of\\nthe Desert and Space.” When Virgin Atlantic Airways began serving passengers\\ndrinks with ice cubes shaped like Branson’s face, he became “The Ice King.”\\nIs Branson just a normal businessman who happens to be lionized by the media\\nwith the help of a good PR team? Or is he himself a born branding genius rightly\\nsingled out by the journalists he is so good at manipulating? It’s hard to tell—maybe\\nhe’s both.\\n\\n Another example is Sean Parker, who started out with the ultimate outsider\\nstatus: criminal. Sean was a careful hacker in high school. But his father decided that\\nSean was spending too much time on the computer for a 16-year-old, so one day he\\ntook away Sean’s keyboard mid-hack. Sean couldn’t log out; the FBI noticed; soon\\nfederal agents were placing him under arrest.\\nSean got off easy since he was a minor; if anything, the episode emboldened him.\\nThree years later, he co-founded Napster. The peer-to-peer file sharing service\\namassed 10 million users in its first year, making it one of the fastest-growing\\nbusinesses of all time. But the record companies sued and a federal judge ordered it\\nshut down 20 months after opening. After a whirlwind period at the center, Sean was\\nback to being an outsider again.\\nThen came Facebook. Sean met Mark Zuckerberg in 2004, helped negotiate\\nFacebook’s first funding, and became the company’s founding president. He had to\\nstep down in 2005 amid allegations of drug use, but this only enhanced his notoriety.\\nEver since Justin Timberlake portrayed him in The Social Network, Sean has been\\nperceived as one of the coolest people in America. JT is still more famous, but when\\nhe visits Silicon Valley, people ask if he’s Sean Parker.\\n\\n The most famous people in the world are founders, too: instead of a company,\\nevery celebrity founds and cultivates a personal brand. Lady Gaga, for example,\\nbecame one of the most influential living people. But is she even a real person? Her\\nreal name isn’t a secret, but almost no one knows or cares what it is. She wears\\ncostumes so bizarre as to put any other wearer at risk of an involuntary psychiatric\\nhold. Gaga would have you believe that she was “born this way”—the title of both\\nher second album and its lead track. But no one is born looking like a zombie with\\nhorns coming out of her head: Gaga must therefore be a self-manufactured myth.\\nThen again, what kind of person would do this to herself? Certainly nobody normal.\\nSo perhaps Gaga really was born that way.\\n\\n WHERE KINGS COME FROM\\nExtreme founder figures are not new in human affairs. Classical mythology is full of\\nthem. Oedipus is the paradigmatic insider/outsider: he was abandoned as an infant\\nand ended up in a foreign land, but he was a brilliant king and smart enough to solve\\nthe riddle of the Sphinx.\\nRomulus and Remus were born of royal blood and abandoned as orphans. When\\nthey discovered their pedigree, they decided to found a city. But they couldn’t agree\\non where to put it. When Remus crossed the boundary that Romulus had decided\\nwas the edge of Rome, Romulus killed him, declaring: “So perish every one that\\nshall hereafter leap over my wall.” Law-maker and law-breaker, criminal outlaw\\nand king who defined Rome, Romulus was a self-contradictory insider/outsider.\\nNormal people aren’t like Oedipus or Romulus. Whatever those individuals were\\nactually like in life, the mythologized versions of them remember only the extremes.\\nBut why was it so important for archaic cultures to remember extraordinary people?\\nThe famous and infamous have always served as vessels for public sentiment:\\nthey’re praised amid prosperity and blamed for misfortune. Primitive societies faced\\none fundamental problem above all: they would be torn apart by conflict if they\\ndidn’t have a way to stop it. So whenever plagues, disasters, or violent rivalries\\nthreatened the peace, it was beneficial for the society to place the entire blame on a\\nsingle person, someone everybody could agree on: a scapegoat.\\nWho makes an effective scapegoat? Like founders, scapegoats are extreme and\\ncontradictory figures. On the one hand, a scapegoat is necessarily weak; he is\\npowerless to stop his own victimization. On the other hand, as the one who can\\ndefuse conflict by taking the blame, he is the most powerful member of the\\ncommunity.\\nBefore execution, scapegoats were often worshipped like deities. The Aztecs\\nconsidered their victims to be earthly forms of the gods to whom they were\\nsacrificed. You would be dressed in fine clothes and feast royally until your brief\\nreign ended and they cut your heart out. These are the roots of monarchy: every king\\nwas a living god, and every god a murdered king. Perhaps every modern king is just\\na scapegoat who has managed to delay his own execution.\\n\\n AMERICAN ROYALTY\\nCelebrities are supposedly “American royalty.” We even grant titles to our favorite\\nperformers: Elvis Presley was the king of rock. Michael Jackson was the king of pop.\\nBritney Spears was the pop princess.\\n\\nUntil they weren’t. Elvis self-destructed in the ’70s and died alone, overweight,\\nsitting on his toilet. Today, his impersonators are fat and sketchy, not lean and cool.\\nMichael Jackson went from beloved child star to an erratic, physically repulsive,\\ndrug-addicted shell of his former self; the world reveled in the details of his trials.\\nBritney’s story is the most dramatic of all. We created her from nothing, elevating\\nher to superstardom as a teenager. But then everything fell off the tracks: witness the\\nshaved head, the over-and under-eating scandals, and the highly publicized court\\ncase to take away her children. Was she always a little bit crazy? Did the publicity\\njust get to her? Or did she do it all to get more?\\n\\n For some fallen stars, death brings resurrection. So many popular musicians have\\ndied at age 27—Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and Kurt Cobain, for\\nexample—that this set has become immortalized as the “27 Club.” Before she joined\\nthe club in 2011, Amy Winehouse sang: “They tried to make me go to rehab, but I\\nsaid, ‘No, no, no.’ ” Maybe rehab seemed so unattractive because it blocked the path\\nto immortality. Perhaps the only way to be a rock god forever is to die an early\\ndeath.\\n\\nWe alternately worship and despise technology founders just as we do celebrities.\\nHoward Hughes’s arc from fame to pity is the most dramatic of any 20th-century\\ntech founder. He was born wealthy, but he was always more interested in\\nengineering than luxury. He built Houston’s first radio transmitter at the age of 11.\\nThe year after that he built the city’s first motorcycle. By age 30 he’d made nine\\ncommercially successful movies at a time when Hollywood was on the technological\\nfrontier. But Hughes was even more famous for his parallel career in aviation. He\\ndesigned planes, produced them, and piloted them himself. Hughes set world records\\nfor top airspeed, fastest transcontinental flight, and fastest flight around the world.\\n\\n Hughes was obsessed with flying higher than everyone else. He liked to remind\\npeople that he was a mere mortal, not a Greek god—something that mortals say\\nonly when they want to invite comparisons to gods. Hughes was “a man to whom\\nyou cannot apply the same standards as you can to you and me,” his lawyer once\\nargued in federal court. Hughes paid the lawyer to say that, but according to the\\nNew York Times there was “no dispute on this point from judge or jury.” When\\nHughes was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1939 for his achievements in\\naviation, he didn’t even show up to claim it—years later President Truman found it\\nin the White House and mailed it to him.\\nThe beginning of Hughes’s end came in 1946, when he suffered his third and\\nworst plane crash. Had he died then, he would have been remembered forever as one\\nof the most dashing and successful Americans of all time. But he survived—barely.\\nHe became obsessive-compulsive, addicted to painkillers, and withdrew from the\\npublic to spend the last 30 years of his life in self-imposed solitary confinement.\\nHughes had always acted a little crazy, on the theory that fewer people would want\\nto bother a crazy person. But when his crazy act turned into a crazy life, he became\\nan object of pity as much as awe.\\n\\nMore recently, Bill Gates has shown how highly visible success can attract highly\\nfocused attacks. Gates embodied the founder archetype: he was simultaneously an\\nawkward and nerdy college-dropout outsider and the world’s wealthiest insider. Did\\n\\n he choose his geeky eyeglasses strategically, to build up a distinctive persona? Or, in\\nhis incurable nerdiness, did his geek glasses choose him? It’s hard to know. But his\\ndominance was undeniable: Microsoft’s Windows claimed a 90% share of the market\\nfor operating systems in 2000. That year Peter Jennings could plausibly ask, “Who is\\nmore important in the world today: Bill Clinton or Bill Gates? I don’t know. It’s a\\ngood question.”\\nThe U.S. Department of Justice didn’t limit itself to rhetorical questions; they\\nopened an investigation and sued Microsoft for “anticompetitive conduct.” In June\\n2000 a court ordered that Microsoft be broken apart. Gates had stepped down as CEO\\nof Microsoft six months earlier, having been forced to spend most of his time\\nresponding to legal threats instead of building new technology. A court of appeals\\nlater overturned the breakup order, and Microsoft reached a settlement with the\\ngovernment in 2001. But by then Gates’s enemies had already deprived his company\\nof the full engagement of its founder, and Microsoft entered an era of relative\\nstagnation. Today Gates is better known as a philanthropist than a technologist.\\n\\n THE RETURN OF THE KING\\nJust as the legal attack on Microsoft was ending Bill Gates’s dominance, Steve Jobs’s\\nreturn to Apple demonstrated the irreplaceable value of a company’s founder. In\\nsome ways, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were opposites. Jobs was an artist, preferred\\nclosed systems, and spent his time thinking about great products above all else; Gates\\nwas a businessman, kept his products open, and wanted to run the world. But both\\nwere insider/outsiders, and both pushed the companies they started to achievements\\nthat nobody else would have been able to match.\\n\\nA college dropout who walked around barefoot and refused to shower, Jobs was\\nalso the insider of his own personality cult. He could act charismatic or crazy,\\nperhaps according to his mood or perhaps according to his calculations; it’s hard to\\nbelieve that such weird practices as apple-only diets weren’t part of a larger strategy.\\nBut all this eccentricity backfired on him in 1985: Apple’s board effectively kicked\\nJobs out of his own company when he clashed with the professional CEO brought in\\nto provide adult supervision.\\nJobs’s return to Apple 12 years later shows how the most important task in\\n\\n business—the creation of new value—cannot be reduced to a formula and applied by\\nprofessionals. When he was hired as interim CEO of Apple in 1997, the impeccably\\ncredentialed executives who preceded him had steered the company nearly to\\nbankruptcy. That year Michael Dell famously said of Apple, “What would I do? I’d\\nshut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.” Instead Jobs introduced\\nthe iPod (2001), the iPhone (2007), and the iPad (2010) before he had to resign in\\n2011 because of poor health. By the following year Apple was the single most\\nvaluable company in the world.\\nApple’s value crucially depended on the singular vision of a particular person. This\\nhints at the strange way in which the companies that create new technology often\\nresemble feudal monarchies rather than organizations that are supposedly more\\n“modern.” A unique founder can make authoritative decisions, inspire strong\\npersonal loyalty, and plan ahead for decades. Paradoxically, impersonal\\nbureaucracies staffed by trained professionals can last longer than any lifetime, but\\nthey usually act with short time horizons.\\nThe lesson for business is that we need founders. If anything, we should be more\\ntolerant of founders who seem strange or extreme; we need unusual individuals to\\nlead companies beyond mere incrementalism.\\nThe lesson for founders is that individual prominence and adulation can never be\\nenjoyed except on the condition that it may be exchanged for individual notoriety\\nand demonization at any moment—so be careful.\\nAbove all, don’t overestimate your own power as an individual. Founders are\\nimportant not because they are the only ones whose work has value, but rather\\nbecause a great founder can bring out the best work from everybody at his company.\\nThat we need individual founders in all their peculiarity does not mean that we are\\ncalled to worship Ayn Randian “prime movers” who claim to be independent of\\neverybody around them. In this respect Rand was a merely half-great writer: her\\nvillains were real, but her heroes were fake. There is no Galt’s Gulch. There is no\\nsecession from society. To believe yourself invested with divine self-sufficiency is not\\nthe mark of a strong individual, but of a person who has mistaken the crowd’s\\nworship—or jeering—for the truth. The single greatest danger for a founder is to\\nbecome so certain of his own myth that he loses his mind. But an equally insidious\\ndanger for every business is to lose all sense of myth and mistake disenchantment for\\nwisdom.\\n\\n Conclusion\\nSTAGNATION OR SINGULARITY?\\n\\nI\\n\\nF EVEN THE MOST FARSIGHTED founders cannot plan beyond the next 20 to 30 years,\\n\\nis there anything to say about the very distant future? We don’t know anything\\nspecific, but we can make out the broad contours. Philosopher Nick Bostrom\\ndescribes four possible patterns for the future of humanity.\\nThe ancients saw all of history as a neverending alternation between prosperity\\nand ruin. Only recently have people dared to hope that we might permanently\\nescape misfortune, and it’s still possible to wonder whether the stability we take for\\ngranted will last.\\n\\nHowever, we usually suppress our doubts. Conventional wisdom seems to assume\\ninstead that the whole world will converge toward a plateau of development similar\\nto the life of the richest countries today. In this scenario, the future will look a lot\\nlike the present.\\n\\n Given the interconnected geography of the contemporary world and the\\nunprecedented destructive power of modern weaponry, it’s hard not to ask whether a\\nlarge-scale social disaster could be contained were it to occur. This is what fuels our\\nfears of the third possible scenario: a collapse so devastating that we won’t survive it.\\n\\nThe last of the four possibilities is the hardest one to imagine: accelerating takeoff\\ntoward a much better future. The end result of such a breakthrough could take a\\nnumber of forms, but any one of them would be so different from the present as to\\n\\n defy description.\\n\\nWhich of the four will it be?\\nRecurrent collapse seems unlikely: the knowledge underlying civilization is so\\nwidespread today that complete annihilation would be more probable than a long\\nperiod of darkness followed by recovery. However, in case of extinction, there is no\\nhuman future of any kind to consider.\\nIf we define the future as a time that looks different from the present, then most\\npeople aren’t expecting any future at all; instead, they expect coming decades to\\nbring more globalization, convergence, and sameness. In this scenario, poorer\\ncountries will catch up to richer countries, and the world as a whole will reach an\\neconomic plateau. But even if a truly globalized plateau were possible, could it last?\\nIn the best case, economic competition would be more intense than ever before for\\nevery single person and firm on the planet.\\nHowever, when you add competition to consume scarce resources, it’s hard to see\\nhow a global plateau could last indefinitely. Without new technology to relieve\\ncompetitive pressures, stagnation is likely to erupt into conflict. In case of conflict on\\na global scale, stagnation collapses into extinction.\\nThat leaves the fourth scenario, in which we create new technology to make a\\nmuch better future. The most dramatic version of this outcome is called the\\nSingularity, an attempt to name the imagined result of new technologies so powerful\\nas to transcend the current limits of our understanding. Ray Kurzweil, the bestknown Singularitarian, starts from Moore’s law and traces exponential growth trends\\n\\n in dozens of fields, confidently projecting a future of superhuman artificial\\nintelligence. According to Kurzweil, “the Singularity is near,” it’s inevitable, and all\\nwe have to do is prepare ourselves to accept it.\\nBut no matter how many trends can be traced, the future won’t happen on its\\nown. What the Singularity would look like matters less than the stark choice we face\\ntoday between the two most likely scenarios: nothing or something. It’s up to us. We\\ncannot take for granted that the future will be better, and that means we need to\\nwork to create it today.\\nWhether we achieve the Singularity on a cosmic scale is perhaps less important\\nthan whether we seize the unique opportunities we have to do new things in our own\\nworking lives. Everything important to us—the universe, the planet, the country,\\nyour company, your life, and this very moment—is singular.\\nOur task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the\\nfuture not just different, but better—to go from 0 to 1. The essential first step is to\\nthink for yourself. Only by seeing our world anew, as fresh and strange as it was to\\nthe ancients who saw it first, can we both re-create it and preserve it for the future.\\n\\n Acknowledgments\\nJimmy Kaltreider for helping to think this book through.\\nRob Morrow, Scott Nolan, and Michael Solana for co-creating the Stanford class\\nfrom which we started.\\nChris Parris-Lamb, Tina Constable, David Drake, Talia Krohn, and Jeremiah Hall\\nfor skillfully guiding us to publication.\\nEveryone at Thiel Capital, Founders Fund, Mithril, and the Thiel Foundation for\\nworking hard and smart.\\nOnward.\\n\\n Illustration Credits\\nThe illustrations in this book were drawn by Matt Buck, based on the following\\nimages:\\n8.1: Unabomber, Jeanne Boylan/FBI composite sketch 8.1: Hipster, Matt Buck\\n13.1: Brian Harrison, Business Wire\\n13.1: Elon Musk, Sebastian Blanco and Bloomberg/Getty Images 14.1: Richard\\nBranson, Ethan Miller/Getty Images 14.2: Sean Parker, Aaron Fulkerson,\\nflickr user Roebot, used under CC BY-SA 14.3: Elvis Presley, Michael Ochs\\nArchives/Getty Images 14.3: Michael Jackson, Frank Edwards/Getty Images\\n14.3: Britney Spears, Kevin Mazur Archive 1/WireImage 14.4: Elvis Presley,\\nTom Wargacki/WireImage\\n14.4: Michael Jackson, David LEFRANC/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\\n14.4: Britney Spears, New York Daily News Archive via Getty Images\\n14.5: Janis Joplin, Albert B.

He started PayPal in 1998, led it as CEO,\\n\\nand took it public in 2002, defining a new era of fast and secure online commerce. In\\n2004 he made the first outside investment in Facebook, where he serves as a director.\\nThe same year he launched Palantir Technologies, a software company that\\nharnesses computers to empower human analysts in fields like national security and\\nglobal finance. He has provided early funding for LinkedIn, Yelp, and dozens of\\nsuccessful technology startups, many run by former colleagues who have been\\ndubbed the “PayPal Mafia.” He is a partner at Founders Fund, a Silicon Valley\\nventure capital firm that has funded companies like SpaceX and Airbnb. He started\\nthe Thiel Fellowship, which ignited a national debate by encouraging young people\\nto put learning before schooling, and he leads the Thiel Foundation, which works to\\nadvance technological progress and long-term thinking about the future.\\nBlake Masters was a student at Stanford Law School in 2012 when his detailed notes on\\n\\nPeter’s class “Computer Science 183: Startup” became an internet sensation. He\\nwent on to co-found Judicata, a legal research technology startup.\\n\\n ')]"
